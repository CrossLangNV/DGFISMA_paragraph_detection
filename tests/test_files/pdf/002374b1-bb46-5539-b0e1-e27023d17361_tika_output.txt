PREFACE

The Joint Expert Group on Reconciliation of 

credit institutions’ statistical and supervisory 

reporting requirements (JEGR) was established 

in June 2008. Since then, its mandate has been 

renewed twice, in 2010 and 2012. Its sponsors 

are the ESCB’s Statistics Committee (STC) 

and Financial Stability Committee (FSC), and 

the European Banking Authority (EBA). Pierre 

Olivier Cousseran (Banque de France) chaired 

the JEGR until end-2011. A list of JEGR 

participants is attached to this publication.

The aim of the JEGR is to bridge elements of the 

statistical and supervisory reporting frameworks 

relating to monetary fi nancial institutions 

(defi nitions, concepts, valuation rules, reporting 

templates, etc.) and, where possible, identify 

reconciliation options between them, taking 

into consideration, on the one hand, the 

framework established by EBA for the reporting 

of fi nancial information compliant with 

international accounting standards (FINREP), 

capital adequacy data requirements (COREP) 

and Large Exposures (LE) and, on the other 

hand, the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) 

statistical reporting framework for monetary 

fi nancial institutions’ balance sheet items (BSI) 

and monetary fi nancial institution interest rates 

(MIR) statistics based on the European System 

of Accounts (ESA).

In particular, the JEGR has developed a 

classifi cation system comprising the following 

two elements:

a methodological bridging manual 1) 

containing a thorough analysis of the areas 

of potential overlap between the ECB’s 

statistical reporting requirements and 

selected supervisory requirements addressed 

to credit institutions; and

a relational database which mirrors the 2) 

bridging manual, aiming to systemically 

identify possible links (commonalities and 

differences) between these requirements.

The classifi cation system has helped the ECB 

and the EBA to identify cases where differences 

between the two reporting frameworks are not 

justifi ed by differences in the analytical use of the 

data. The JEGR considers that in such instances 

there is scope for reconciliation between the 

two frameworks, and hence for a reduction 

of the reporting burden on credit institutions. 

Moreover, the relational database aims to 

help reporting agents identify similarities and 

differences between their reporting obligations 

in an easy and accurate manner, and is designed 

to facilitate – under certain conditions – 

respondents’ data production processes. For 

these reasons, the JEGR work has also been 

strongly supported by the banking industry.

The ECB and the EBA have already published 

a fi rst version of the classifi cation system in 

February 2010. This new edition includes further 

enhancements and updates. It also includes a 

series of reconciliation proposals which are in 

the process of being implemented by the ECB 

and EBA. These proposals have a general impact 

on the BSI, MIR, FINREP, COREP and LE 

frameworks as they bring closer to each other 

important aspects such as instrument defi nitions 

and classifi cation, sector classifi cation, 

consolidation and accounting rules.

Under its renewed mandate (endorsed in 

February 2012), the JEGR will continue 

to act as a forum for fruitful dialogue 

between statistical and supervisory experts. 

In particular, it will maintain the classifi cation 

system by ensuring that the methodological 

bridging manual remains up to date, in view 

of forthcoming changes to FINREP, COREP 

and LE (including possible extensions regarding 

the liquidity framework and the leverage 

ratio), as a result of forthcoming amendments 

to the Capital Requirements Directive, as well 

as potentially relevant changes to statistical 

(e.g. securities holdings statistics) or macro-

prudential data requirements. In turn, this work 

may provide room for further reconciliation and 

the reduction of reporting costs in the future 

and to further develop the functionality of the 

relational database.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Joint Expert Group on Reconciliation of 

credit institutions’ statistical and supervisory 

reporting requirements (JEGR) was established 

in June 2008. Its mandate was twice renewed in 

2010 and 2012. Its sponsors are the ESCB’s 

Statistics Committee (STC) and Financial 

Stability Committee (FSC), and the European 

Banking Authority (EBA).1

The aim of the JEGR is to identify and promote 

common elements in the statistical and revised 

supervisory reporting frameworks relating to 

credit institutions (e.g. defi nitions, concepts, 

valuation rules, reporting templates) and, where 

possible, to reconcile them. These reporting 

frameworks are:

Monetary Financial Institutions’ (MFI) • 

balance sheet and interest rate statistics, 

designed mainly to provide data for ECB 

monetary policy purposes. Credit institutions 

form the largest part of the MFI sector. So 

far as possible, these statistics conform 

to international and European statistical 

standards, currently the European System 

of Accounts (ESA 95, to be replaced by 

the ESA 2010 in 2014). The MFI balance 

sheet Regulation was adopted in December 

2008, and the interest rate Regulation in 

December 2001, with major amendments in 

March 2009.2 The new requirements were 

implemented in 2010.

The FINancial REPorting (FINREP) • 

framework, designed for credit institutions 

which use the international accounting 

standards (IAS/IFRS) in their published 

fi nancial statements and must submit similar 

information to their supervisory authorities. 

FINREP was devised by the Committee of 

European Banking Supervisors (CEBS), 

now the EBA,3 in 2005; the current version 

(Rev 2),4 published in December 2009, took 

effect in January 2012.

The COmmon solvency ratio REPorting • 

(COREP) framework, for use by credit 

institutions under the Basel framework as 

implemented with the EU capital adequacy 

regime. COREP, also devised by the 

CEBS, dates from 2006; the current version 

(Rev. 3),5 published in April 2011 and 

applicable as of 31 December 2011. COREP 

is methodologically consistent with FINREP, 

at least for credit institutions applying IAS/

IFRS. COREP will soon also include the 

common reporting of Large Exposures 

(LE), defi ned in the context of capital 

adequacy as exposures to connected entities 

exceeding 10% of a credit institution’s 

capital. The LE templates were published in 

December 2009.6 

In seeking to reconcile the reporting frameworks, 

the JEGR must respect the different purposes 

which they were designed to serve and the 

accounting principles underlying them. 

To meet this goal, the JEGR has developed a 

classifi cation system for the ECB’s statistical 

requirements relating to credit institutions’ 

balance sheets and interest rates and the relevant 

supervisory guidelines established by the EBA. 

This classifi cation system comprises two parts, 

the present methodological manual and a 

relational database.7

It may be useful to explain briefl y why statistical 

and supervisory data are different. The main use 

of the statistical balance sheet data reported by 

credit institutions (banks) and other monetary 

The European Banking Authority was established by Regulation 1 

(EC) No. 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the 

Council of 24 November 2010. It offi cially came into being on 

1 January 2011 and has taken over all the tasks and responsibilities 

of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS).

These are Regulations ECB/2008/32, ECB/2001/18 and 2

1 INTRODUCTION

fi nancial institutions 8 is to support monetary 

policy analysis and trace the transmission of 

monetary policy actions to the economy. For 

this purpose, the focus of interest is the total 

amount of their monetary liabilities and credit 

extended, who holds the money, and who 

borrows from them. The emphasis is on the 

counterparties rather than on the credit 

institutions because it is their spending and 

saving decisions which infl uence economic 

developments. The monetary and lending data 

with the vital counterparty information are not 

viewed in isolation, but are embedded in 

comprehensive and integrated economic and 

fi nancial accounts compiled quarterly within a 

conceptual framework laid out in the world 

System of National Accounts and the ESA 

derived from it. These standards defi ne sectors 

(households, non-fi nancial corporations, 

fi nancial corporations, government) as groups 

of entities displaying similar economic 

behaviour, and make a strict distinction between 

resident and non-resident entities. These sector 

defi nitions are important for monetary analysis, 

because (for example) an increase in the money 

holdings of households or non-fi nancial 

corporations may have different implications 

from an increase in money held by (non-

monetary) fi nancial corporations. The residence 

distinction matters because the ECB’s monetary 

policy responsibility is confi ned to the euro area, 

and neither non-residents’ holdings of monetary 

instruments nor residents’ holdings of monetary 

claims on entities abroad are considered to have 

the same signifi cance for monetary analysis as 

residents’ holdings of monetary instruments 

issued by resident credit institutions and 

other MFIs. 

These concepts of sector and residence are 

standard across the world, to enable economic 

developments to be easily compared across 

countries. Harmonisation is particularly 

important in the European Union/euro area, so 

that coherent area aggregates can be compiled. 

Consistency of data over time is also necessary, 

to enable economic and fi nancial developments 

to be put in perspective over long periods, 

allowing “through-the-cycle” assessments. 

The MFI interest rate data provide essential 

information on the transmission of monetary 

policy monetary initiatives to the interest 

rates received and paid by households and 

non-fi nancial corporations in the euro area. 

The two reporting schemes are complementary.

For supervisory purposes, it is the bank which 

is at the heart of the story. The focus is the 

individual bank or the banking group, and in 

particular the various kinds of risk to which it 

is exposed and the adequacy of its capital in 

view of these risks. Looking at resident banking 

offi ces alone is insuffi cient: the position 

of branches and subsidiaries abroad is also 

relevant, as may be that of resident and foreign 

non-banking fi nancial affi liates. Hence, the 

banking group may cross national, euro area and 

EU boundaries, and may include institutions 

which are not classifi ed as credit institutions 

or MFIs more broadly, in which case group 

consolidated data will cut across statistical 

categories. Counterparties are of interest mainly 

from the perspective of credit risk concentration 

and diversifi cation. Their residence status is 

relevant, if at all, in that context. Risks concern 

also currency and maturity mismatches (with the 

emphasis on residual maturity, not the original 

maturity recorded for most statistical purposes), 

legal matters and operational processes. Hence, 

they may arise from contracts or operations 

which do not feature on the statistical balance 

sheet. How all the risks faced by the supervised 

institutions are interconnected is important.

The rules concerning the valuation of assets 

and liabilities, the timing of recording of 

transactions, and whether or not certain items 

are recorded on the balance sheet may also differ 

between supervisory and statistical standards. 

Credit institutions form by far the largest part of the monetary 8 

fi nancial institutions (MFI) sector in Europe. The MFI sector 

includes, in addition to credit institutions, other institutions with 

liabilities included in the ECB’s defi nition of broad money (M3): 

these are central banks, money market funds (quite numerous 

in some EU countries), and other fi nancial institutions with 

monetary liabilities including issuers of electronic money. Only 

credit institutions are relevant to the links between the ECB’s 

statistical reporting framework and the FINREP/COREP/Large 

Exposures frameworks, and so to the work of the JEGR and the 

scope of this manual.

Finally, although the development of a bank’s 

business and the relative profi ts and losses 

over time may be relevant, the supervisory 

function is less interested in time series and 

more concerned with a snapshot of the bank’s 

or banking group’s current position and in 

assessing its prospects. 

The main differences between these reporting 

frameworks are summarised in the table below.

MFI balance sheet and interest rate statistics and EBA guidelines on FINREP and COREP/Large Exposures

March 2012

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite these differences in use and focus of 

the reported information, the statistical and 

supervisory data have much in common. This 

is particularly true for the credit institutions’ 

statistical balance sheet and the FINREP 

supervisory framework. In contrast, links 

between the statistical balance sheet and the 

COREP framework, and between MFI interest 

rate statistics and the FINREP/COREP/Large 

Exposures frameworks, are weaker. 

The reconciliation work proposed so far by the 

JEGR is refl ected in the FINREP and COREP 

frameworks, the MFI Regulations and a manual 

on MFI balance sheet statistics (recently published 

by the ECB).

It may be worth noting that, while the MFI 

balance sheet and interest rate statistics (for 

credit institutions in the euro area) and COREP/

Large Exposures reporting are all mandatory, 

FINREP is not compulsory: on the basis 

of the draft amendments to the EU Capital 

Requirements Directive (so-called CRD IV 

amendments), however, it is expected that the 

number of credit institutions reporting FINREP 

information will increase by 2012, bringing an 

increasing overlap with the MFI population, 

although perhaps not in all euro area countries.

This methodological manual provides a thorough 

overview of the differences and commonalities 

between the ECB statistical framework and the 

EBA supervisory framework. It presents all the 

bridging work that has been done by the JEGR 

to date. The JEGR is aware that the reporting 

frameworks (in particular FINREP and COREP) 

will be amended again, and in fact the present 

manual takes into account the latest versions of 

FINREP, COREP and LE. 

The relational database is designed to 

complement this methodological manual, with 

which it is fully consistent, by helping data 

compilers identify the relationship between the 

different reporting requirements, thereby 

potentially reducing the reporting burden on 

respondents. The relational database is 

accompanied by a users’ guide.9

Based on this methodological manual and the 

relational database, the JEGR has submitted 

proposals to its sponsors on how to exploit 

the links and promote synergies between the 

different reporting requirements. The JEGR is 

publishing this manual and a shorter summary 

version translated into other EU languages, to 

make it accessible to a wider, less technical 

audience. 

The structure of this document is as follows. 

Chapter 2 identifi es links between the statistical 
balance sheet and FINREP, focusing on the 

purposes and main features of the two reporting 

schemes and describing their organisation. It 

then points out the common elements in the 

main methodological concepts underlying them. 

It concludes with some considerations on the 

collection and compilation of fl ow statistics 

(transactions). 

Chapter 3 identifi es links between the statistical 
balance sheet and the COREP – Large Exposures 

framework, comparing the instrument 

breakdown in the statistical balance sheet with 

the COREP and Large Exposures templates 

covering credit risk (including securitisation), 

market risk, own funds and operational risk. 

Chapter 4 relates statistical requirements for 
interest rate data to supervisory reporting 

(COREP, FINREP and Large Exposures). The 

main features of statistical requirements for 

interest rates are discussed fi rst, referring to the 

breakdown by type of risk and the corresponding 

COREP-Large Exposures templates. Chapter 4 

then looks at the structure of FINREP and the 

links with statistical interest rate data. 

Annexes provide further background 

information.

The box below provides a summary of main 

conclusions and fi ndings of the JEGR.

Box 1

MAIN CONCLUSIONS AND FINDINGS OF THE JEGR

One of the main differences between the statistical and supervisory reporting systems concerns 

the degree of consolidation of the reported data. The scope of consolidation of banks’ branches 
and subsidiaries defi ned in the MFI balance sheet and interest rate Regulations is different 

from that of FINREP, COREP and Large Exposures. While statistical reporting must make 

residence and sector distinctions, it is not so important to do so in the supervisory framework. 

The statistical balance sheet reporting is defi ned on the basis of the “host” residency principle 

and on an individual institution basis, whereas the reporting under COREP/Large Exposures 

and FINREP (where applicable) on an individual basis – which, unlike the MFI balance sheet 

statistics, includes foreign banking branches – follows the “home” residency basis. In addition, 

the FINREP and COREP/Large Exposures frameworks are applied also on a group consolidated 

basis using the consolidation approach in the Capital Requirements Directive (for FINREP, the 

IFRS consolidation approach is also an option). These different practices make a large difference 

to the data for credit institutions with foreign branches/subsidiaries.

The MFI balance sheet Regulation requires loans and deposits to be reported at nominal value, 
without deduction of provisions from loans (even though central banks may in practice allow 

reporting net of loan provisions). For other instruments the valuation rules in the MFI balance 
sheet Regulation are fl exible. In particular, the recommendation for statistical reporting of 

holdings and issues of securities at market/fair values, irrespective of whether the securities are 

held for trading or until maturity, is not binding. In practice, those held to maturity are likely to 

be measured at amortised cost, in accordance with IAS 39. In legal terms, institutions required 

or allowed to use IAS/IFRS and which report supervisory information on the basis of FINREP 

may use the same valuation concepts when reporting for MFI balance sheet purposes, except for 

loans and deposits. For the latter instruments, reconciliation is possible between fair value or 

amortised cost and nominal value. 

MFI balance sheet and FINREP requirements are consistent as regards the need to record interest 

on an accruals basis, but differ in their requirement regarding the classifi cation of accrued 
interest not yet paid. The MFI balance sheet Regulation requires accrued interest on loans and 

deposits to be reported under remaining assets/liabilities,  separately identifi ed where possible. 

In FINREP, accrued interest is recorded with the underlying instrument (as indeed is the 

preference of the ESA 95). 

The treatment of items subject to securitisation operations is complex. As explained in Chapter 2, 
the need for monetary policy purposes is to ensure that loans which have been removed from 

credit institutions’ balance sheets under a traditional “true sale” securitisation are not lost to 

view, or indeed that loans which have been securitised but not derecognised and so remain on the 

balance sheet are not counted twice. Synthetic securitisations where only the credit risk (but not 

the underlying assets) is transferred are not recorded in MFI balance sheet statistics, while the 

complementary reporting by fi nancial vehicle corporations (FVCs) may provide a rough picture 

of such credit risk transfers, to the extent that FVCs are resident in the euro area. The MFI 

balance sheet Regulation does not contain rules for on-balance sheet recognition/derecognition 

as such; (de)recognition practice may follow either the IAS/IFRS approach, as in FINREP,

1 INTRODUCTION

or local GAAPs. The detailed statistical reporting requirements are designed so as to enable the 

data derived from the different accounting approaches to give consistent results.

The MFI balance sheet Regulation does not allow netting (offsetting assets against related 
liabilities), and the rules defi ned in the IAS/IFRS for netting, also applied in FINREP, are 

de facto in line with this approach. 

Although there are permitted exceptions, in the MFI balance sheet reporting scheme, loans 

should be reported gross of all provisions, until the point at which they are written off or written 
down as wholly or partially irrecoverable. In FINREP, loans are reported in the balance sheet net 

of accumulated impairment losses. 

The residency concept in the MFI balance sheet Regulation and the FINREP guidelines on 

geographical breakdown are consistent, though as explained earlier the application is different. 

FINREP and MFI statistics apply defi nitions of counterpart sectors that can be easily bridged. 

MFI balance sheet requirements are for classifi cation of fi nancial assets and liabilities mainly 

according to original maturity, but also according to residual maturity for some breakdowns. 
FINREP has no requirements for original or residual maturity breakdowns, although IFRS 7 

requires institutions to disclose remaining or residual maturities of liabilities, but without 

specifying standard time bands. 

It is possible to set up a bridge between the instruments requested in the two reporting schemes 
despite differences in their balance sheet structure. This bridging may be facilitated if the IAS/

IFRS accounting fl exibility is used to bring it closer to the MFI balance sheet requirements, 

though some differences will remain. The revised FINREP guidelines on breakdown by type of 

loan are in line with statistical defi nitions for some items.

To complement MFI interest rate statistics, the balance sheet Regulation has recently added a 

requirement for information on loans backed by real estate collateral with a loan-to-value ratio 
of 1 or below, following the defi nition in the Capital Requirements Directive. These data are 

therefore a subset of mortgage loans in FINREP, which include any loans collateralised against 

real estate, regardless of the loan-to-value ratio. 

The IFRS defi nition of equity instruments, also applied in FINREP, excludes instruments which 
may sound similar but which are liabilities for the issuer (e.g. certain cooperative shares). The 

Capital Requirements Directive defi nition of equity exposures, as applied in COREP, includes 

certain debt exposures whose economic substance is similar to that of residual claims on the 

assets or income of the issuer. The MFI balance sheet instrument class “shares and other equity” 

in principle comprises only instruments that are classifi ed as equity for the issuer. Hence, 

the CRD defi nition of “equity exposures” and the FINREP category “equity instruments” may be 

considered as equivalent to the MFI balance sheet defi nition of “shares and other equity”. How 

far preferred shares (issued) in MFI balance sheet statistics coincides with the defi nition in the 
FINREP guidelines is not clear at present.

The MFI balance sheet Regulation requires information on revaluation adjustments to enable 
transactions approximating the ESA 95 defi nition to be derived from balance sheet outstanding

amounts. Although FINREP does not require explicit revaluation adjustments, there are 

substantial similarities between the two reporting schemes with regard to requirements for fl ows 

(transactions). 

There is signifi cant overlap between the MFI balance sheet requirements and the COREP 

templates for credit risk and market risk. For securitised assets, the link applies both for cases 
where the reporting agent is the originator of the securitised loans and for those where it holds 

securities issued by the securitisation vehicle. Conversely, there are no links between the MFI 

balance sheet requirements and the COREP template on operational risk.

Finally, there is a signifi cant overlap between the MFI balance sheet requirements and the 

COREP template for own funds.

All in all, the links between the MFI balance sheet reporting requirements and the FINREP/

COREP templates are extensive. Those between FINREP/COREP and MFI interest rates, on the 

other hand, are rather weak. Different objectives limit their common features to the defi nitions 

and sector/instrument classifi cations; moreover, the data requirements differ substantially. 

Nevertheless some similarities are noted in Chapter 4.

BALANCE 

SHEET-FINREP
2 STATISTICAL BALANCE SHEET-FINREP

2.1 THE PURPOSE OF THE TWO REPORTING 

FRAMEWORKS

This section provides information on the 

background to the development of two 

reporting schemes, namely statistical balance 

sheet reporting (shortened in what follows to 

BSI – the ECB’s acronym for balance sheet 

items) and IAS/IFRS compliant fi nancial 

reporting (FINREP). It recalls their main 

purposes (statistical and macroeconomic versus 

microprudential), explaining why they differ.  

2.1.1 MFI BALANCE SHEET PURPOSES

After lengthy preparatory work, the ECB’s 

Governing Council adopted in 1998 an ECB 

Regulation stating the requirements for the 

compilation of the consolidated balance sheet 

of the euro area monetary fi nancial institutions 

(MFI) sector.1 These requirements were 

enhanced in 2001 and again in 2008 – see 

Regulation (recast) ECB/2008/32.2

The requirement relates to the regular production 

of a properly articulated aggregated balance 

sheet of the money-creating (issuing) sector for 

the participating Member States, seen as a single 

monetary area, in terms of stocks and fl ows 

(transactions). This dataset is the source for 

euro area monetary aggregates and counterparts 

(see below), and provides some additional detail 

for further analysis of monetary developments. 

It also serves other statistical purposes, such as 

fi nancial accounts and balance of payments.

The statistical system in place for the 

compilation of BSI statistics is based on two 

main elements:  (1) the defi nition of the money-

issuing sector, and (2) the fi nancial instruments 

to be covered. The fi rst element, relating to the 

defi nition of the money-issuing sector (MFIs), 

determines the reporting population. The ECB’s 

defi nition of the euro area monetary aggregates 

is based on harmonised defi nitions of the money-

issuing sector and the money-holding sectors. 

The money-issuing sector comprises MFIs 

resident in the euro area; the money-holding 

sectors comprise all non-MFIs resident in the 

euro area excluding central government. The 

BSI data are compiled by aggregating MFIs’ 

individual balance sheets; they are consolidated 

at the sector level, meaning that all inter-MFI 

positions are cancelled out because only the 

business of the resident (euro area) MFIs with 

the euro area money-holding sectors is needed. 

Individual MFI balance sheet data are relevant 

only as contributions to the aggregate.

The second element refers to the specifi cation of 

the statistical information to be collected. The 

monetary aggregates mainly comprise 

(harmonised) categories of MFI liabilities.3 The 

Eurosystem has defi ned a narrow (M1), an 

intermediate (M2) and a broad (M3) monetary 

aggregate, which differ with regard to the degree 

of liquidity (in terms of transferability, 

convertibility, price certainty and marketability) 

of the MFI liabilities they include. Hence, 

BSI statistics require MFI liabilities to be broken 

down by instrument, original maturity and – 

although the monetary aggregates are all-

currency concepts – currency of denomination. 

The counterparts to M3 comprise all other items 

in the consolidated MFI balance sheet arranged 

in an analytically useful way. For consistent and 

meaningful results, these must also be reported 

in a harmonised manner.

How data behave over a long period is a core 

element in monetary analysis, requiring a 

stable and robust set of statistical defi nitions 

(e.g. sector coverage needs to be stable over 

Consolidation in this context means the elimination of assets 1 

and liabilities within the MFI sector, which differs from the 

consolidation approach at banking group level used in the context 

of fi nancial supervision or fi nancial stability analysis, which 

mostly concerns the perimeter of fi nancial institutions subject to 

the supervisory law (see Section 2.3.1 for more details).

See a list of the most relevant legal acts in Annex 1.2 

Central banks are MFIs, so banknotes and coins and any other 3 

monetary liabilities they may have are included. The monetary 

aggregates also include some monetary liabilities of entities 

which are not MFIs (in some countries central government 

agencies and post offi ce giro institutions take deposits); these are 

reported separately and added in.

time – see Section 2.3.9). Balance sheet (stocks) 

information needs also to be complemented 

with fi nancial transactions (fl ows) 4 for the 

compilation of growth rates. This is because 

growth rates are not calculated simply as the 

change in the relevant outstanding amounts, but 

exclude valuation effects, reclassifi cations and 

certain other infl uences on balance sheets which 

are not transactions as defi ned in the international 

statistical standards. In general, harmonisation 

of defi nitions and concepts is a very important 

aspect in statistics, especially in the compilation 

of euro area aggregates, where a lack of it would 

harm the quality of euro area fi gures. 

The accounting practices underlying BSI 

statistics refer, in addition to the relevant 

international statistical standards, to the national 

transposition of the Banking Accounts Directive 

(BAD),5 and supervisory and accounting 

standards (IAS/IFRS, where applied at national 

level to MFI balance sheets on a solo basis), 

with one important exception where accounting 

standards should not be strictly followed 

(valuation of deposits and loans). This fl exible 

approach minimises the reporting burden, as 

the same set of (accounting) rules are largely 

used for fi nancial reporting and, to the extent 

possible, statistical reporting.  

2.1.2 FINREP OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSES

The introduction of the international accounting 

standards (IAS/IFRS) in Europe prompted 

considerable changes to the administrative/

accounting systems of credit institutions using 

these standards for their fi nancial reporting 

purposes, and has also compelled European 

supervisory authorities to adapt their prudential 

fi nancial reporting. These circumstances 

created an opportunity for convergence of 

supervisory practices. Using IAS/IFRS as the 

basis for prudential reporting provides scope for 

further alignment of supervisory and fi nancial 

reporting and ultimately for harmonisation of 

the prudential reporting frameworks within the 

European Union.6 

Against this background, and motivated by the 

absence of prescribed reporting formats under 

IAS/IFRS, the CEBS (now EBA) engaged in the 

development of guidelines for a standardised 

consolidated and harmonised fi nancial reporting 

framework (FINREP) for credit institutions 

consistent with the international accounting 

standards. Currently, the framework is not 

intended to cover either all disclosure 

requirements of IAS/IFRS or solo reporting;7 

rather, it was devised for use by EU supervisory 

authorities when asking for consolidated 

fi nancial information from credit institutions for 

supervisory purposes. In other words, FINREP 

is specifi cally intended for credit institutions 

that use IFRS for their fi nancial reporting and 

must provide periodic fi nancial statements to 

their supervisory authorities. An overview of 

the use of FINREP across EU countries is 

provided in Annex 3.

FINREP, like COREP, does not serve only the 

need for microprudential data on individual 

banks. These frameworks also provide much of 

the information required for macroprudential 

analysis of the banking sector as a whole. 

In particular, the uniform and mandatory 

application of COREP (possibly to be extended 

to some parts of FINREP) in the European Union 

will contribute to improving the assessment of 

profi tability and capital adequacy with regard to 

the risks faced by the European banking system. 

For instance, the more granular geographical 

and sectoral breakdowns of exposures presented 

in the non-core tables of FINREP support a more 

detailed and deeper analysis of potential sources 

of fi nancial vulnerability and the challenges 

posed to fi nancial stability by different kinds of 

risk within the banking sector. 

In the case of BSI statistics, fi nancial transactions (fl ows) 4 

are currently compiled as differences of stocks corrected for 

revaluations and other volume changes in fi nancial assets and 

liabilities (see Section 2.4 for more detailed information).

Council Directive 86/635/EEC of 8 December 1986, as 5 

amended.

Over time, the European Commission has endorsed almost all 6 

IAS/IFRSs within the so-called IAS Regulation. See http://

ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/legal_framework/

Regulations_adopting_ias_text_en.htm

As in many countries credit institutions are or will be required/7 

allowed to use IAS/IFRS in solo accounting, national supervisory 

authorities may adapt FINREP for solo fi nancial reporting.

2 STATISTICAL 

BALANCE 

SHEET-FINREP
FINREP also aims to reduce European 

companies’ reporting burden by presenting 

a harmonised fi nancial reporting framework 

for prudential purposes for use across Europe 

by the different supervisory authorities. 

Harmonisation of defi nitions and concepts 

at the EU level is increasingly important for 

prudential supervision and fi nancial stability 

purposes, especially for peer group analysis and 

the compilation of national, euro area or EU 

aggregates where a lack of it would harm the 

quality of the analysis.

Unlike the BSI requirements, the FINREP 

revised framework is still not mandatory.8 

Nevertheless, national supervisory authorities 

are strongly recommended to use the framework. 

As a means to strengthen the implementation 

at the national level, the revised Guidelines 

explain that when the national authorities do not 

apply the framework, they must inform the EBA 

Secretariat and publicly explain their reasons on 

both the EBA and their own websites.    

Under the new FINREP Guidelines published 

in December 2009 9, the EBA decided to adopt 

explicit minimum and maximum reporting 

requirements, i.e. to use the “maximum data 

model” which limits reporting requirements to 

the core and non-core information specifi ed in the 

framework. The minimum reporting requirement 

will be the “core” information (templates 1.1, 

1.2, 1.3, and 2). 10 The maximum reporting 

requirement will be the core information plus 

the “non-core” information contained in the 

rest of the templates. Each supervisor is free 

to choose a point anywhere between these two 

extremes. In any case, supervisory authorities 

may not modify the templates based on national 

needs. This approach represents a compromise 

between the need for fl exibility to accommodate 

different supervisory needs and the desire for 

greater convergence and harmonisation. 

Supervisory reporting 11 requirements rely on 

two main sets of data: (1) individual company 

data and (2) consolidated data at the group level. 

Firstly, national supervisory authorities are 

(mainly) engaged in analysing the fi nancial 

conditions of individual credit institutions. 

Although the fi nancial position of the sector as a 

whole or of institutions in the same peer group 

may ultimately have an impact on the fi nancial 

conditions faced by individual institutions 

(contagion risk), prudential supervision is 

mainly about the fi nancial situation of the 

individual institution at a certain moment in 

time.12 In this context, while temporal analysis 

may be appealing and helpful in many 

circumstances, fi nancial supervision is more 

about future prospects and fi nancial soundness, 

and past performance is only relevant so far as it 

infl uences the present and future condition of 

the institution(s). 

Secondly, fi nancial supervision requires the 

availability of consolidated accounts at the 

reporting-group level (see Section 2.3.1 of 

this chapter for a more extensive explanation). 

The supervisory and accounting concepts 

of consolidation involve the netting out 

of transactions and positions between all 

units within a reporting group. The scope of 

consolidation in IAS 27 requires parent entities 

to consolidate fi nancial statements of all (resident 

and non-resident; fi nancial and non-fi nancial) 

subsidiaries. Supervisory standards (the Basel 

framework, as transposed in the European Union 

via the Capital Requirements Directive) require 

the scope of consolidation of banks’ accounts 

to be limited to fi nancial institutions other than 

insurance companies. Thus, subsidiaries which 

According to the draft CRD IV amendments, some parts of 8 

FINREP may become mandatory.

FINREP is based on the International Financial Reporting 9 

Standards (IFRS) as of 31 October 2009, which have been 

endorsed by the European Commission. Changes to the 

accounting standards affecting FINREP (e.g. changes that may 

arise in IAS 39 and IAS 1) are being assessed by the EBA.

This means that that when an authority decides to apply the 10 

FINREP framework to supervised credit institutions within 

its jurisdiction, it must, at the minimum, require institutions to 

report the “core” information.

That is, FINREP, COREP and Large Exposures.11 

A distinction should be drawn between prudential supervision 12 

(looking more at the micro aspects) and fi nancial stability 

(looking at the macro aspects), as the analysis and related data 

requirements of the two functions differ. In general, fi nancial 

stability analysis relies, among other data sources, on the 

aggregation of data used primarily for fi nancial supervision 

purposes.

are non-fi nancial corporations are excluded from 

the consolidation.

In FINREP, the consolidation scope is the same 

as that required by the Capital Requirements 

Directive (CRD), for all the templates: credit 

institutions and other fi nancial institutions 

are fully consolidated, while the accounts 

of insurance companies and non-fi nancial 

corporations – if any – use the equity method.13 

In addition, national supervisory authorities may 

collect a limited set of templates using the IAS 

27 consolidation scope. 

2.2  THE STRUCTURE OF THE TWO REPORTING 

FRAMEWORKS

This section provides a brief explanation of 

the logic behind the organisation of the two 

reporting schemes.

2.2.1 MFI BALANCE SHEET: STRUCTURE

The statistical framework in place for the 

compilation of the consolidated balance sheet 

of the euro area MFI sector is based on a set of 

(fi ve) monthly and quarterly tables, which 

are inter-connected and complementary 

(see Annex 1). These double-entry tables are 

generally organised in instrument rows, with 

additional detail by currency and original 

maturity, and across the top by sector of 

counterpart, country or currency, depending on 

the table. The BSI Regulation provides detailed 

defi nitions for the variables to be reported. 

Table 1 – Stocks: This monthly table requires 
stock data on the business of MFIs with suffi cient 

detail to provide the ECB with a comprehensive 

statistical picture of monetary developments 

in the participating Member States seen as one 

economic territory and to allow fl exibility in 

the calculation of monetary aggregates and 

counterparts covering the euro area. The data 

supplied in this table are generally broken down 

by: (1) instrument, (2) sector of counterpart, 

(3) residency (domestic/other participating 

Member States/rest of the world/not allocated), 

(4) original maturity, (5) currency (euro/other), 

and (6) purpose for loans to households (credit 

for consumption/lending for house purchase/

other lending). The table is reported to the ECB 

15 working days after the end of the reference 

period to enable monthly monetary statistics 

to be reported within four weeks (and always 

in time for the fi rst ECB Governing Council 

meeting of the following month).

Table 1A – Revaluation adjustments: The 
ESA distinguishes between a transaction (“an 
economic fl ow that is an interaction between 
institutional units by mutual agreement”) and 
other infl uences on balance sheet levels, 

including the effect of changes in market prices 

on the value of securities held on the balance 

sheet and of write-offs/write-downs of loans, 

both of which are included in revaluation 

adjustments. Monthly data on revaluation 

adjustments, together with information from 

other sources on reclassifi cations and exchange 

rate changes affecting balance sheet items, 

contribute to the compilation of fl ow statistics 

(transactions) for the monetary aggregates and 

counterparts.14 Although more limited, the data 

supplied in this table are also generally broken 

down by: (1) instrument, (2) sector of 

counterpart, (3) residency (domestic/other 

participating Member States/rest of the world/

not allocated), (4) original maturity, (5) currency 

(euro/other), and (6) purpose (credit for 

consumption/lending for house purchase/other 

lending). The table is reported to the ECB 

15 working days after the end of the reference 

period.

Table 2 – Sector breakdown: Sector breakdowns 
matter for monetary analysis because (for 

example) an increase in the money holdings of 

households may have a different signifi cance 

than the same increase in the hands of non-

monetary fi nancial corporations. Key sector 

breakdowns are reported monthly in Table 1. 

“The equity method is a method of accounting whereby the 13 
investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter 
for the post-acquisition change in the investor’s share of net 
assets of the investee. The profi t or loss of the investor includes 
the investor’s share of the profi t or loss of the investee” 
(IAS 28.2).

For more details on the compilation of fl ow statistics, see 14 

Section 2.4.

2 STATISTICAL 

BALANCE 

SHEET-FINREP
This quarterly table requires additional detail on 

the sector breakdown of certain items in Table 1. 

The quarterly sector detail relates mainly to 

a fi ner breakdown of the general government 

sector and the rest of the world, as well as the 

other resident sectors (for some instruments). 

The data supplied in this table are generally 

broken down by: (1) instrument, (2) sector 

of counterpart, (3) residency (domestic/other 

participating Member States/rest of the world), 

and (4) original maturity. For loans, there are 

further breakdowns by (5) remaining maturity 

and (6) purpose/real estate collateralisation. The 

table is reported to the ECB 28 working days 

after the end of the reference period. 

Table 3 – Country breakdown: This 
quarterly table requires additional information 

on the breakdown of positions (stocks) vis-

à-vis individual EU countries and the rest 

of the world (i.e. outside the European 

Union). The data supplied in this table 

are broken down by: (1) instrument, 

(2) sector of counterpart (MFIs and non-MFIs), 

(3) residency (country by country), and (4) 

original maturity (only for holdings of securities 

other than shares). The table is reported to 

the ECB 28 working days after the end of the 

reference period.

Table 4 – Currency breakdown: This 
quarterly table requires detailed information 

broken down by currency (euro/remaining EU 

currencies – individually for “loans”, and for 

other items GBP/USD/JPY/CHF/remaining 

currencies together).15 The data supplied 

in this table are further broken down by: 

(1) instrument, (2) sector of counterpart (MFIs 

and non-MFIs), (3) residency (domestic/other 

participating Member States/rest of the world), 

and (4) original maturity (only for deposits and 

loans vis-à-vis the rest of the world). The table 

is reported to the ECB 28 working days after the 

end of the reference period.

Table 5a – Securitisations and other loan 
transfers: In the absence of further information, 
securitisations and other loan transfers which 

result in the removal of loans from MFI balance 

sheets present a problem for monetary analysis, 

since they make it appear that credit available to 

borrowers has fallen. The information provided 

monthly in this table and (quarterly) in Table 5b 

(see below), together with complementary 

information provided by fi nancial vehicle 

corporations (FVCs), the usual counterparties of 

MFIs in securitisations, under a separate ECB 

Regulation addressed to them (ECB/2008/30), 

avoids this misunderstanding. This monthly 

table requires the reporting of net fl ows of loans 

securitised or otherwise transferred, separately 

for transactions with and without impact on 

reported loan stocks, as well as the reporting of 

the outstanding amounts of securitised loans 

serviced and securitised loans not derecognised.16 

The data supplied in this table are broken down 

by: (1) type (FVCs and total) and residency 

(euro area and total) of the counterparty in the 

transfer, (2) sector(s) of the borrowers whose 

loans are being transferred, and (3) their 

residency (domestic/other participating Member 

State/rest of the world). The table is reported to 

the ECB 15 working days after the end of the 

reference period.

Table 5b – Securitisations and other loan 
transfers: This quarterly table requires 
additional detail on the items reported in 

the monthly securitisation table (Table 5a) 

where the counterparty in the transfer is a 

FVC, separately for euro area FVCs and as a 

total. The detailed data requirements relate 

mainly to a breakdown of the net fl ows of 

loans, with impact on reported loan stocks, by 

(1) purpose and (2) original maturity. There is 

also a requirement in respect of the outstanding 

amounts of loans which have been securitised, 

but which the credit institution continues to 

service, broken down by: (1) type (FVCs and 

total) and residency (euro area and total) of the 

counterparty in the transfer, (2) sector of the 

debtor, (3) residency of the debtor (domestic/

other participating Member State/rest of the 

world), and (4) original maturity (only for 

These data are mainly used to assess the impact of exchange rate 15 

changes on balance sheet outstandings. This is important for the 

derivation of fl ows (transactions) data – see Section 2.4.

loans to non-fi nancial corporations). The table 

is reported to the ECB 28 working days after 

the end of the reference period.

Non-balance sheet information: An annual 
table requires the reporting of two variables: 

the number of transferable overnight deposit 

accounts, and the number of transferable 

internet/PC-linked overnight deposit accounts. 

Annual statistics must be transmitted to the 

ECB according to a calendar communicated 

by the ECB each year (the transmission date is 

typically in June of the following year).

2.2.2 FINREP STRUCTURE

IAS/IFRS, unlike Directive 86/635/EEC, do 

not impose a single standardised reporting 

format.17 On the other hand, FINREP provides a 

harmonised reporting format and a standardised 

set of information items based on a common 

accounting framework. It has been designed for 

credit institutions that use IAS/IFRS for their 

published fi nancial statements and must provide 

similar information in the periodic prudential 

reports they are required to submit to their 

supervisory authorities. It includes references to 

the relevant IAS/IFRS and provides defi nitions 

for the variables that are not defi ned in 

IAS IFRS. 

Under IAS/IFRS, fi nancial instruments may 

be presented in the balance sheet by type 

of instrument (instrument approach) or by 

category of fi nancial instrument (portfolio 

approach). In FINREP, preference has been 

given to the portfolio approach (fi rst level), but 

each portfolio includes a breakdown by type of 

instrument (second level): derivatives, loans and 

advances, debt securities and equity instruments 

on the assets side; derivatives, deposits and debt 

securities issued on the liabilities side. Indeed, 

fi nancial instruments are presented by categories 

of fi nancial asset and fi nancial liability, in 

accordance with IAS 39.9 and IFRS 7.8. 

Consequently, on the fi rst level of the assets 

side of the FINREP balance sheet, fi ve main 

IAS categories of fi nancial assets are recognised 

(see Section 2.3.11).18 

Financial assets held for trading 1 – This 
is a subcategory of fi nancial assets at 

fair value through profi t and loss which: 

(1) are acquired principally for the purpose of 

selling in the near term, and (2) are part of 

a portfolio of identical fi nancial instruments 

that are managed together and for which there 

is evidence of a pattern of short-term profi t-

taking. A fi nancial derivative not used for 

hedge accounting would be included here;

Financial assets designated at fair 2 
value through profi t and loss – Any 
non-derivative fi nancial asset within the 

scope of IAS 39 may be designated at fair 

value through profi t and loss upon initial 

recognition, provided that some criteria are 

met, with the exception of equity instruments 

that do not have a quoted market price in an 

active market and whose fair value cannot 

be reliably measured;

Loans and receivables (including fi nance 3 
leases) – Non-derivative fi nancial assets 
with fi xed or determinable payments that are 

not quoted in an active market and are not 

classifi ed in the previous two categories or 

as available for sale (IAS 39.9).19 

Held-to-maturity investments 4 – Non-
derivative fi nancial assets with fi xed or 

determinable payments and fi xed maturity 

Nevertheless, IAS 1 prescribes the basis for presentation of 17 

“general purpose fi nancial statements” (i.e. those intended to 

serve users who do not have the authority to demand fi nancial 

reports tailored for their own needs), to ensure comparability 

both with the entity’s fi nancial statements of previous periods 

and with the fi nancial statements of other entities. IAS 1 sets out 

the overall framework and responsibilities for the presentation of 

fi nancial statements, guidelines for their structure and minimum 

requirements for the content of the fi nancial statements.

In fact, IAS 39 only defi nes four categories of fi nancial instruments. 18 

The FINREP fi fth category is simply the breakdown of the IAS 

category “Financial assets designated at fair value through profi t 

and loss” into two to distinguish those fi nancial instruments that 

are covered by the so-called fair value option from the trading 

portfolio. Financial assets can also be included in FINREP items 

“Cash and cash equivalents” and “Non-current assets and disposal 

groups classifi ed as held for sale”; in the latter aggregated item 

they are included together with non-fi nancial assets.

Debt securities not traded in active markets can be classifi ed in 19 

this category.

that the entity has the intention and ability 

to hold until maturity, if not classifi ed 

elsewhere. It should be noted that this 

category should be empty if, during the 

current fi nancial year or in the previous two 

fi nancial years, the entity sold or reclassifi ed 

more than an insignifi cant amount of held-

to-maturity investments before maturity 

(IAS 39.9).

Available-for-sale fi nancial assets 5 – Non-
derivative fi nancial assets that are designated 

as available for sale or are not classifi ed in 

the other categories.

Financial liabilities under FINREP are presented 

in three main categories: fi nancial liabilities 

which the holder may trade (rather than retain 

to maturity); fi nancial liabilities designated at 

fair value through profi t and loss; and fi nancial 

liabilities recorded at amortised cost. 20

FINREP is composed of a set of tables which 

contain quantitative fi nancial information divided 

into two sections designated as “core” and “non-

core”, respectively.21 Financial information which 

under IFRS may be provided in the form of a 

disclosure note has also been integrated in the 

framework in the form of a table. 

The core fi nancial information consists of the 

minimum supervisory reporting requirement 

to be applied by credit institutions if and when 

required by their national supervisory authority 

to prepare consolidated prudential fi nancial 

reporting under IAS/IFRS. This comprises the 

following tables: 

Table 1.1 – Consolidated balance sheet 
statement (Statement of Financial Position) – 
Assets: As mentioned above, on the asset side 
of the consolidated balance sheet, fi nancial 

instruments are presented following the portfolio 

approach (each portfolio is subsequently broken 

down by instrument). In addition, there are 

also entries for derivatives – hedge accounting, 

participations interests, fi xed assets (tangible and 

intangible), tax assets and other minor items.  

Table 1.2 – Consolidated balance sheet 
statement (Statement of Financial Position) – 
Liabilities: On the liability side of the 
consolidated balance sheet also, fi nancial 

instruments are organised following the portfolio 

approach (each portfolio is subsequently broken 

down by instrument). In addition, there are 

also entries for derivatives – hedge accounting, 

provisions, tax liabilities and other minor items.    

Table 1.3 – Consolidated balance sheet 
statement (Statement of Financial Position) – 
Equity: This refers to equity issued by the credit 
institution. The table is organised by instrument. 

A distinction is made between the different 

forms of equity, reserves, valuation adjustments, 

minority interests, and income attributable to the 

current year.  

Table 2 – Consolidated income statement: 
This table shows income and expenses 

from continuing operations separately from 

discontinued operations. Items of income 

or expense from continuing operations are 

presented by type. Major headings are broken 

down with reference to the balance sheet 

categories of fi nancial instruments. Gains 

(losses) on fi nancial assets and liabilities are 

presented on a net basis on the face of the 

consolidated income statement. A breakdown 

of the net gains (losses) by category or by type 

of instrument is sometimes required in the case 

of the consolidated income statement. Income 

(expenses) from discontinued operations is 

disclosed as a net single amount.

FINREP also foresees the provision of non-

core fi nancial information (from Table 3 to 

Table 25). In general, the non-core tables 

provide additional details of the core tables 

and contribute to the standardisation of the 

data items that are more often reported to 

Financial liabilities can also be included in the aggregated item 20 

“Liabilities included in disposal groups classifi ed as held for 

sale” together with non-fi nancial assets.

2.3  THE LINKS BETWEEN THE TWO REPORTING 

FRAMEWORKS

This section compares various methodological 

aspects associated with the two reporting 

schemes. Four subsections describe the key 

similarities and differences between the two 

sets of requirements, concluding with a general 

assessment of comparability. Specifi cally, 

the subsections cover aspects regarding 

1) the reporting population, 2) accounting, 

3) breakdowns, and 4) the treatment of specifi c 

items. Annex 4 provides the basis for developing 

links between the two frameworks in a more 

systematic way. Indeed, this has been achieved 

with the relational database.

2.3.1 REPORTING POPULATION

Article 1 of the BSI Regulation (as amended 

by Regulation ECB/2011/12) 22 defi nes the 

reporting population for the compilation of the 

consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector. 

The reporting population consists of MFIs 

resident in the territory of participating Member 

States. The defi nition of MFI is contained in 

the amended Article 1 as follows: “… MFI 
means a resident undertaking that belongs to 
any of the following sectors: (i) central banks;23 
(ii) credit institutions as defi ned in Article 4(1) 
of Directive 2006/48/EC; (iii) other MFIs, i.e. 
(1) other resident fi nancial institutions whose 
business is (i) to receive deposits or close 
substitutes for deposits from entities other 
than MFIs; and (ii) for their own account, 
at least in economic terms, to grant credits 
and/or make investments in securities; or 
(2) such electronic money institutions that are 
principally engaged in fi nancial intermediation 

in the form of issuing electronic money; 
(iv) money market funds as defi ned in Article 
1a.” The amended BSI Regulation says that 
MMFs are collective investment undertakings 

which, notably, “…pursue the investment 
objective of maintaining a fund’s principal and 
providing a return in line with the interest rates 
of money market instruments; invest in money 
market instruments which comply with the 
criteria for money market instruments set out in 
Directive 2009/65/EC…or deposits with credit 
institutions or, alternatively, ensure that the 
liquidity and valuation of the portfolio in which 
they invest is assessed on an equivalent basis; 
ensure that the money market instruments they 
invest in are of high quality…; ensure that their 
portfolio has a weighted average maturity of no 
more than 6 months and a weighted average 
life of no more than 12 months…”. They may 
not take direct or indirect exposure to equity 

or commodities, and must use derivatives only 

in line with their money market investment 

strategy. Any holdings of foreign currency 

instruments must be hedged; MMFs may use 

foreign exchange derivatives only for hedging 

purposes. 

One important element in defi ning the reporting 

population in BSI statistics is the concept of 

residency: only institutions incorporated and 

located in the participating Member States 

(in the euro area), including subsidiaries of 

parent companies headquartered outside the 

euro area and branches of institutions with head 

offi ces outside the euro area, are part of the 

reporting population.24

In order to provide for a consistent application 

of the MFI defi nition, the ECB, in close 

cooperation with the national central banks, 

maintains for statistical purposes a list of MFIs 

The amendments were necessitated by new EU legislation 22 

concerning MMFs and issuers of e-money.

As noted earlier, in the ESA 95 fi nancial institutions classifi ed 23 

as MFIs are divided into two subsectors, namely central banks 

(S.121) and “other MFIs” (S.122).

Subsidiaries are separately incorporated entities in which another 24 

entity has a majority or full participation, whereas branches are 

unincorporated entities (without independent legal status) totally 

owned by the parent. 



24
ECB

resident in each participating Member State 

(and also in other EU countries, though MFIs 

established there are not bound by ECB 

statistical legislation) in accordance with the 

classifi cation principles outlined above. To keep 

the reporting burden within reasonable limits, 

national central banks may exempt  small MFIs 

from full reporting, provided that their combined 

contribution to the national MFI balance sheet in 

terms of stocks does not exceed 5%. Central banks 

may also grant further predefi ned derogations 

specifi cally to other credit institutions provided 

that their combined contribution to the national 

MFI balance sheet in terms of stocks exceeds 

neither 10% of the national MFI balance sheet nor 

1% of the euro area MFI balance sheet (Article 

8 of the BSI Regulation). The derogations for 

credit institutions apply without prejudice to the 

requirements for the calculation of minimum 

reserves, as all credit institutions are subject to 

minimum reserve requirements regardless of 

size. Apart from those which benefi t from these 

derogations, all MFIs resident in the euro area 

must comply with the reporting requirements 

set out in the ECB’s BSI Regulation.

The reporting population for FINREP purposes 

is slightly different. All EU credit institutions 

whose securities are listed on EU markets 

have been required to use IAS/IFRS for their 

consolidated fi nancial statements since January 

2005. In addition, Member States may also extend 

the application of IAS/IFRS to the consolidated 

fi nancial statements of unlisted credit institutions 

and to the individual accounts of all credit 

institutions.25 Hence, as FINREP defi nes an IAS/

IFRS compliant supervisory reporting scheme, 

in theory all EU credit institutions and other 

supervised fi nancial corporations may potentially 

be requested to report consolidated supervisory 

data using the FINREP framework. However, 

so far the practical implementation of FINREP 

has remained a matter of national discretion (for 

example, the date of implementation, the actual 

reporting population, the use of the core and non-

core part and its frequency). This is a difference 

from the MFI balance sheet reporting, which 

is not a matter for national discretion (except 

in granting derogations as explained above). 

However, as mentioned above, some parts of 

FINREP may become mandatory from 2013, 

following the implementation of the (draft) CRD 

IV amendments. Annex 3 to this manual provides 

an overview of the current scope of application 

of IAS/IFRS and FINREP, for banks, in each EU 

country.

Following the recommendations of the European 

Parliament and of the European Council, in order 

for the necessary level of supervisory convergence 

and cooperation at the European Union level to 

be achieved and the stability of the fi nancial 

system to be underpinned, the EBA is currently 

working on the development of uniform technical 

reporting standards for the European Union, with 

uniform formats, frequencies and dates of 

reporting for the competent authorities to apply 

from 31 December 2012. The reporting formats 

will be proportionate to the nature, scale and 

complexity of the credit institutions’ activities, 

striking a balance between implementing a single 

set of harmonised rules and avoiding unduly 

complicated Regulation and enforcement. The 

use of the FINREP framework by national 

supervisory authorities is, however, strongly 

recommended in order for the harmonisation and 

reduction of the reporting burden to be achieved. 

No decision has yet been taken on the 

enforceability of the FINREP templates, although 

the draft CRD IV amendments 26 propose that the 

reporting of some fi nancial information, drawn 

up in accordance with either the international 

accounting standards or national standards in 

accordance with the BAD, becomes uniform and 

mandatory. For banks without subsidiaries, this 

may imply the application of some FINREP 

templates at the solo level.

Conclusion: as a result of the Council/
Commission initiative, it is expected that the 

number of credit institutions reporting FINREP

the IAS Regulation (1606/2002) in the EU and EEA (published 

for information purposes only)”, of 25 February 2008, and

information will increase by 2012, increasing 

the overlap with the MFI population. Moreover, 

following the CRD IV amendments, the 

application of some FINREP templates may 

become mandatory in all EU countries, also 

for non-IFRS credit institutions and at the solo 

level.

2.3.2 ACCOUNTING ASPECTS

This subsection covers seven accounting aspects 

regarding: a) the consolidation scope in the 

different reporting frameworks, b) valuation 

criteria, c) time of recording, d) treatment of 

accrued interest, e) recognition and derecognition, 

f) netting (offsetting arrangements), and 

g) impairment of assets (basis of recording).

a) The scope of consolidation in the different 

reporting frameworks

This subsection deals with the differences in 

the scope of consolidation in the reporting 

requirements stemming from accounting, 

regulatory and statistical frameworks. As 

differences in the coverage of institutions 

included in group- and sector-level consolidation 

often have implications for the data, it is 

important to clarify the coverage in the different 

consolidation approaches, presented here in four 

parts. Part A recalls the consolidation approach 

in the ECB’s monetary statistics and bank 

interest rates; Part B focuses on the supervisory 

and accounting reporting requirements; Part C 

presents the consolidation approaches followed 

in selected macroprudential datasets, such as the 

IMF’s Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI), 

the ESCB’s Consolidated Banking Data (CBD) 

and the BIS International Banking Statistics 

(IBS); the coverage of the consolidation 

perimeter of fi nancial conglomerates is discussed 

in Part D.

A – Statistical consolidation

The scope of “consolidation” under the 

framework for monetary and interest rate 

statistics covered by ECB BSI/MIR Regulation 

refers only to solo accounts. 

At the solo reporting level – or individual 

basis – credit institutions included in the MFI 

sector should report the business of all their 

banking offi ces (registered or head offi ce, and/or 

branches) located in the same national territory 

(“host” principle). Parent companies classifi ed 

as credit institutions may also be permitted 

to consolidate the business of their banking 

subsidiaries located in the same national territory 

in their statistical returns, provided – as should 

always be the case – that these subsidiaries are 

classifi ed as MFIs. 

Consolidation for statistical purposes is permitted 

neither in respect of subsidiaries which are not 

MFIs, nor in any circumstances across national 

boundaries. Thus, if an institution has branches 

located outside the national territory, the 

registered or head offi ce must report positions 

with them on a gross basis as positions vis-à-vis 

non-residents – no consolidation is allowed. 

Similarly, all MFIs which are branches of a non-

resident institution must report positions with 

the registered or head offi ce or with other 

branches of the same institution located outside 

the country as positions vis-à-vis non-residents.27

 

B – Regulatory and accounting consolidation

Under the COREP (and if applied, FINREP) 

framework, supervisory data must be reported 

on a solo basis, including in the data the business 

of all banking offi ces (branches) without regard 

to the country in which they are located. This 

is an important difference from solo reporting 

under the BSI/MIR Regulation and in other 

macroeconomic statistics, where branches 

located abroad are considered to be separate 

institutional units in the host country.

In addition to solo reporting, FINREP (and 

COREP) are also compiled at the consolidated 

group level. There are essentially two forms of 

group consolidation: 1) the scope defi ned by 

the CRD and 2) the IFRS scope. The FINREP 

(since its Rev. 2) and COREP frameworks have 

adopted the CRD approach to consolidation as 

a general rule for all the templates. However, 

Institutions located in offshore fi nancial centres are treated 27 

statistically as residents of the territories in which the centres are 

located.

a selected number of templates of the FINREP 

framework can be collected using the IFRS

a schematic representation of the CRD and IFRS 

scope of consolidation.

The approach to consolidation foreseen 

in the CRD is defi ned in Article 133 (1). 

“The competent authorities responsible for 
supervision on a consolidated basis shall, 
for the purposes of supervision, require full 
consolidation of all the credit institutions and 
fi nancial institutions which are subsidiaries of 
a parent undertaking.” Article 134 (2) adds that 
the business of undertakings providing ancillary 

banking services and asset management 



27
ECB

BALANCE 

SHEET-FINREP
companies should also be consolidated. 

In practice, for capital requirements purposes, 

parent credit institutions (or parent fi nancial 

holding companies) 28 consolidate fi nancial 

institutions (but not insurance undertakings, 

and not non-fi nancial subsidiaries). However, 

supervisory authorities may require information 

about these subsidiaries when deemed relevant 

for the purpose of supervising subsidiaries 

which are credit institutions (Article 137 (1)), in 

particular in the context of Directive 2002/87/

EC on the supplementary supervision of 

credit institutions, insurance undertakings and 

investment fi rms in a fi nancial conglomerate 

(see Part D below).

In addition, for prudential purposes and for the 

calculation of capital requirements, a credit 

institution may be required to consolidate the 

business of a subsidiary of an entity which is not 

itself included in the group consolidation – for 

example, an investment fi rm that is a subsidiary 

of an insurance corporation (not consolidated) 

within a group headed by a credit institution. 

In this case, the insurance corporation must be 

accounted for using the equity method (according 

to the parent credit institution’s ownership 

share) while the investment fi rm must be fully 

consolidated. 

The IFRS consolidation scope is defi ned in 

IAS 27 and IAS 31, which require parent entities 

to consolidate fi nancial statements of all (resident 

and non-resident) subsidiaries. If, after 

acquisition, a subsidiary meets the criteria to be 

classifi ed as held for sale in accordance with 

IFRS 5,29 it must be accounted for in accordance 

with that standard.30 IAS 27 elaborates further: 

a subsidiary should not be excluded from 

consolidation because its business is different 

from that of the parent. This means that fi nancial 

corporations like insurance companies, and also 

non-fi nancial corporations, must be consolidated. 

The same approach applies to joint ventures 

(irrespective of the business) that according 

to IAS 31 are consolidated on the basis of the 

proportionate method. However, IAS 31 also 

provides for an alternative way of consolidating 

these entities, namely the equity method, under 

which joint ventures are accounted for according 

to the percentage of ownership by the holding 

company (investor), as in the case of associates. 

C – THE SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION IN SELECTED 

MACROPRUDENTIAL DATASETS

This part briefl y reviews the consolidation 

approach followed in three macroprudential 

datasets: (i) the IMF’s Financial Soundness 

Indicators (FSIs), (ii) the ESCB’s Consolidated 

Banking Data (CBD), and (iii) the BIS’s 

International Banking Statistics (IBS).

The IMF’s Financial Soundness Indicators(i) 

A crucial feature of the IMF’s FSIs is the 

consolidation approach at both the group 

and sector levels. There are in fact different 

analytical approaches for different needs which 

are discussed in the FSI Compilation Guide. In 

particular, the domestically-controlled cross-

border and cross-sector consolidation basis 

(DCCBS) encompasses the activity of a parent 

bank and all its branches and subsidiaries 

According to Article 125(1) of the CRD, “if the parent of a credit 28 

institution is a fi nancial holding company in a Member State 

or an EU parent fi nancial holding company, supervision on a 

consolidated basis shall be exercised by the competent authority 

that authorised the credit institution.” Article 126.(1), states that 

“if credit institutions authorised in two or more Member States 

have as their parent the same fi nancial holding company in a 

Member State or the same EU parent fi nancial holding company, 

supervision on a consolidated basis shall be exercised by the 

competent authorities of the credit institution authorised in the 

Member State in which the fi nancial holding company was set 

up.” In addition, still in accordance with the Article 126.(2) 

“where more than one credit institution authorised in the 

Community has as its parent the same fi nancial holding company 

and none of these credit institutions has been authorised in the 

Member State in which the fi nancial holding company was set 

up, supervision on a consolidated basis shall be exercised by 

the competent authority that authorised the credit institution 

with the largest balance sheet total, which is to be considered 

as the credit institution controlled by an EU parent fi nancial 

holding company.” Finally, in accordance with Article 126.(3) 

of the Directive 2006/48/EC, “in particular cases, the competent 

authorities may by common agreement waive the two criteria 

above if their application would be inappropriate, taking into 

account the credit institutions and the relative importance of their 

activities in different countries, and appoint a different competent 

authority to exercise supervision on a consolidated basis”.

IFRS 5 deals with “non-current assets held for sale and 29 

discontinued operations”.

The concept of control is crucial in the defi nition and is explained 30 

in detail in paragraphs 13-15 of IAS 27.

worldwide, as is the case with the supervisory 

perspective where the focus is the income and 

capital of the parent bank with its subsidiaries 

and the risks facing the global institution. The 

DCCBS also consolidates the business of diverse 

domestically-controlled fi nancial institutions 

operating abroad or in different sectors, in line 

with the approach of the Basel Committee. The 

cross-border and cross-sector consolidation basis 

for all domestically incorporated (CBCSDI) 

deposit-takers may also be relevant for economies 

hosting signifi cant foreign-controlled deposit-

takers, since their business will be consolidated 

with that of the foreign parent. The IMF leaves 

the choice between DCCBS and CBCSDI to 

national discretion.

SHEET-FINREP
The ESCB’s consolidated banking data(ii) 

The CBD dataset consists of aggregated 

microprudential data on banks’ profi tability, 

balance sheets, asset quality, and solvency 

ratios in the 27 EU countries. The CBD have 

been collected annually since 2002 (and more 

recently semi-annually), fi ve months after 

the year end. Data on EU domestic banks are 

reported by bank size (large, medium and 

small). Data are also separately reported for 

foreign-controlled banks active in EU countries, 

in particular branches and subsidiaries (further 

broken down by control by entities in other EU 

countries and in non-EU countries). 

The CBD compiled by the ESCB follow in 

principle the consolidation approach of the EU 

Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and are 

based on aggregated information on the banking 

systems of all EU Member States. In former 

issues of the ECB Report on EU Banking Sector 
Stability, data that comply with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) have been 

treated separately from data complying with 

local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

(GAAPs), since the conceptual differences 

between the accounting regimes were thought 

to be too substantial to render the aggregation 

of IFRS and non-IFRS data meaningful. In the 

more recent issues of the Report it has been 
decided to display both IFRS and non-IFRS 

items within the same country data.  

The CBD are fully consolidated on a cross-

border basis (data on branches and subsidiaries 

located outside the domestic market are 

consolidated with the data reported by the parent 

institution) and on a cross-sector basis (branches 

and subsidiaries of banks that can be classifi ed 

as other fi nancial institutions are included). 

Insurance companies, however, are not 

included.31 In addition, information is provided 

on foreign-controlled institutions active in 

EU countries. The CBD therefore follow the 

CBCSDI approach, with a split between the 

DCCBS and the FCCBS. However, national 

approaches may differ due to the prevailing 

supervisory reporting frameworks.

The BIS’s International Banking Statistics(iii) 

There is a key distinction between the BIS 

locational and consolidated banking statistics. 

The quarterly locational statistics cover the 

“aggregate international claims and liabilities 
of all banks resident in the 43 reporting 
countries broken down by instrument, currency, 
sector, country of residence of counterparty 
for all bank nationalities per reporting country 
(IBLR – International Banking Locational by 
Residence), and also by currency, residency 
type (residents/non-residents) and sector 
for individual nationality of reporting banks 
per reporting country (IBLN – International 
Banking Locational by Nationality). Both 
domestic and foreign-owned banking offi ces in 
the reporting countries report their positions on 
a gross basis (except for derivative contracts for 
which a master netting agreement is in place) 
and on an unconsolidated basis, including those 
vis-à-vis own affi liates, which is consistent with 
the principles of national accounts, money and 
banking, balance of payments and external debt 
statistics.” The locational statistics therefore 
follow the host country approach used in the 

ECB’s MFI balance sheet statistics.

By contrast, the quarterly consolidated statistics 

cover the worldwide consolidated international 

fi nancial claims of domestically-owned banks 

broken down by remaining maturity and sector 

of borrower. They indicate the nature and extent 

of consolidated foreign claims of banking 

groups headquartered in 30 major fi nancial 

centres.32

The consolidation approach followed for 

compiling the BIS consolidated banking 

statistics is based on national implementation 

of BCBS (Basel Committee on Banking 

Supervision) supervisory standards, which have 

been transposed in the European Union via the 

CRD. A small number of national compilers 

follow a more comprehensive accounting

approach, in that they also include non-bank 

subsidiaries in their consolidated contribution.

In other words, EU national compilers are 

currently free to choose between the IFRS 

and the CRD consolidation approaches. The 

consolidated banking statistics are collected on a 

group worldwide-consolidated basis, excluding 

inter-offi ce positions and including the exposures 

of foreign offi ces (i.e. subsidiaries and branches). 

The BIS monitors consolidation approaches 

because reporting countries have a large degree 

of discretion in consolidating, which may affect 

data comparability across countries.

The consolidated banking data are available 

on two bases, immediate borrower basis and 

ultimate risk basis. The positions on an ultimate 

risk basis (the country of ultimate risk is 

defi ned as the country in which the guarantor 

of a fi nancial claim resides and/or the country 

in which the head offi ce of a legally dependent 

branch is located) provide information regarding 

on-balance sheet foreign claims as well as other 

potential exposures (on- and off-balance sheet) 

such as derivatives, guarantees and credit 

commitments, and are currently reported by 

24 countries.

D – CONSOLIDATION WITHIN FINANCIAL 

CONGLOMERATES AS DEFINED IN THE EU 

DIRECTIVE  

A fi nancial conglomerate according to the EU 

Directive 2002/87/EC (Article 2) is a group 

headed by a regulated entity (a credit institution, 

insurance undertaking or investment fi rm), or a 

group where at least one of the subsidiaries in 

the group is a regulated entity, and at least one of 

the entities in the group is within the insurance 

sector and at least one is within the banking 

or investment services sector. A fi nancial 

conglomerate – to qualify as such for prudential 

purposes – must have signifi cant business in 

both the insurance and banking areas.33

From an accounting perspective, the applicable 

scope of consolidation is the IFRS framework if 

the fi nancial conglomerate is a group which 

must prepare consolidated accounts in 

conformity with Articles 4 or 5 of Regulation 

(EC) No. 1606/2002.34 Otherwise, the accounting 

Directive 83/349/EC applies. The latter Directive 

provides for the consolidation of all subsidiary 

undertakings.35

From a prudential perspective, Directive 

2002/87/EC Article 6, requires supplementary 

capital adequacy to be calculated using one of 

the following four methods: 

the accounting consolidation method 1) 

(consistent with IFRS); 

the deduction and aggregation method; 2) 

the book value/requirement deduction 3) 

method;  

a possible combination of the previous three 4) 

methods.

The accounting consolidation method requires 

the supplementary capital adequacy needs of the 

regulated entities in a fi nancial conglomerate to 

be based on the consolidated accounts.

The deduction and aggregation method requires 

the calculation to be based on the accounts of 

each of the entities in the group, with a sum 

of all the components and the deduction of the 

book value of the participations in other entities 

of the group (non-fi nancial corporations).

The book value/requirement deduction method 

provides that the calculation must be carried 

out on the basis of the accounts of each of the 

entities in the group, starting with the parent 

undertaking or the entity at the head of the 

fi nancial conglomerate, with the accounts of all 

the other entities then added.

Conclusion: the scope of consolidation of banks’ 
branches and subsidiaries defi ned in the BSI and 

See Directive 2002/87/EC Articles 2 and 3.33 

When securities issued by members of the group are admitted 34 

to trading on a regulated market of any Member State or the 

Member State permits or requires the group to prepare such 

consolidated accounting according to the IFRS framework.

MIR Regulations differs from that of FINREP, 

COREP and Large Exposures. The BSI reporting 

is defi ned on the basis of the “host” residency 

principle on an individual basis, whereas 

COREP/Large Exposures on an individual 

basis (and FINREP, where applicable) follow 

the “home” basis. In addition, the FINREP 

and COREP/Large Exposures frameworks 

are also applied on a consolidated “group” 

basis using the CRD consolidation approach

(for FINREP, the IFRS consolidation approach 

is also an option).

Different consolidation approaches are also used 

in various macroprudential datasets, depending 

on the risk perspective (see Part C above), for 

instance in the ESCB Consolidated Banking 

Statistics, the BIS International Banking 

Statistics, or the IMF Financial Soundness 

Indicators. 

In the case of fi nancial conglomerates, the 

provisions of the related directive are applied 

for regulatory purposes, while the applicable 

accounting standards are applied for fi nancial 

reporting.

b) Valuation criteria

The accounting rules underlying the collection 

of MFI statistics for monetary policy purposes 

are defi ned in Article 7 of the BSI Regulation, 

which states that “unless otherwise provided for 
in this Regulation, the accounting rules followed 
by MFIs for the purposes of reporting under 
this Regulation shall be those laid down in the 
national transposition of Council Directive 
86/635/EEC of 8 December 1986 on the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts of banks 
and other fi nancial institutions, as well as in 
any other international standards applicable. 
Deposit liabilities and loans shall be reported 
at the principal amount outstanding at the 
end of the month and on a gross basis. Write-
downs as determined by the relevant accounting 
practices shall be excluded from this amount. 
Deposit liabilities and loans shall not be netted 
against any other assets or liabilities. Without 
prejudice to accounting practices and netting 
arrangements prevailing in Member States, all 

fi nancial assets and liabilities shall be reported 
on a gross basis for statistical purposes. NCBs 
may allow the reporting of provisioned loans 
net of provisions and the reporting of purchased 
loans at the price agreed at the time of their 
acquisition, provided that such reporting 
practices are applied by all resident reporting 
agents and are necessary to maintain continuity 
in the statistical valuation of loans with the data 
reported for periods prior to January 2005.” 
To ensure that loans and deposits are reported 

monthly at nominal value, it is clearly stated in 

the BSI Regulation that accrued interest on loans 

(deposits) should be reported under remaining 

assets (liabilities).36 

With the exception of loans and deposits, the 

BSI Regulation allows central banks to require 

credit institutions when reporting for statistical 

purposes to follow other international accounting 

standards, i.e. IAS/IFRS.37 In that regard, the 

introduction of the IAS/IFRS and its use in the 

European Union in place of the national GAAPs 

(see Annex 3) have contributed to the 

harmonisation of the valuation rules and to 

strengthening the link between the requirements 

for statistical and for fi nancial supervision in 

terms of valuation (fair value accounting or 

amortised cost), except for loans and deposits.38 

The BSI Manual 39 recommends MFIs to present 

asset and liability positions at current market 

values or to use a close equivalent to market 

values. As an exception to this rule, balance 

sheet items (a) currency in circulation, (b) 

deposits, (c) capital and reserves, (d) holdings of 

cash and (e) loans should be reported at nominal 

value. However, with the exception of loans and 

deposits, the ECB accepts that the data submitted 

by MFIs may follow national GAAPs, in 

particular because of the tight reporting 

See Section 2.3.d for more details on the treatment of accruals.36 

National central banks may allow reporting net of loan provisions 37 

under certain conditions.

These valuation concepts may, however, be reconciled, as shown 38 

in Annex 2.

The ECB has published a manual on MFI balance sheet statistics 39 

(BSI Manual) with the aim of supporting the compilation 

of statistics in NCBs by providing a clear and consistent 

understanding of the statistical requirements contained in the 

BSI Regulation and MFM Guideline (ECB/2007/9 (recast) as 

amended), for the production of harmonised BSI statistics.

deadlines. In practice, the reference in the BSI 

Regulation to the national transpositions of the 

Banking Accounts Directive (national GAAPs), 

as well as to any other international accounting 

standards, allows various possibilities for the 

valuation of balance sheet items, with the 

exception of loans and deposits, as specifi ed 

above. Generally, the valuation rules foreseen in 

the BAD are as follows:

Trading portfolio (assets) – Member States • 

may allow credit institutions to value this 

portfolio at purchase price, market price or 

the lower of the two (principle of prudence). 

In any case, the difference between the two 

methods should be disclosed by the credit 

institution;

Financial fi xed assets (participating • 

interests, shares in affi liated undertakings 

and securities intended for use on a 

continuing basis in the normal course of an 

undertaking’s activities) – they should be 

valued at purchase price. However, value 

adjustments may be made in respect of 

fi nancial fi xed assets, so that they are valued 

at the lower fi gure to be attributed to them at 

the balance sheet date. Member States may, 

however, require or permit debt securities 

(including fi xed-income securities) held 

as fi nancial fi xed assets to be shown in the 

balance sheet at the amount repayable at 

maturity (nominal value);

(Other) fi xed assets (tangible and • 

intangible) – in general, they should be 

valued at purchase price or production cost;

Current assets (loans and advances, debt • 

securities, shares and other variable-

yield securities, which are neither held 

as fi nancial fi xed assets nor included in a 

trading portfolio) – they should be valued 

at purchase price without prejudice to any 

value adjustments to cater for the principle of 

prudence; 

Financial liabilities – Following Article 32 • 

of the Fourth Council Directive (BAD), the 

items shown in the balance sheet should be 

valued at the price at which they were sold 

to the holder.40

The valuation rules prescribed for fi nancial 

instruments by the IAS/IFRS are set out in 

IAS 39. This standard recognises the following 

rules for the main fi ve portfolio categories:41

Initial measurement (IAS 39.43) – When • 

fi nancial assets and liabilities are initially 

recognised, an entity must measure them at 

fair value, plus, in the case of fi nancial assets 

or liabilities not at fair value through profi t 

and loss, transaction costs that are directly 

attributed to the acquisition or issue of the 

fi nancial assets and liabilities. In most cases, 

fair value at initial recognition means the 

acquisition costs, as these assets are usually 

bought in markets. 

Subsequent measurement of fi nancial assets • 

(IAS 39.46) – All fi nancial assets must be 

measured at fair value (including derivatives 

held for trading and used in hedge 

accounting), except for the categories “loans 

and receivables” and “held-to-maturity 

investments”, which must be measured at 

amortised cost using the effective interest 

method.42 Investments in equity instruments 

that do not have a quoted market price in an 

active market and whose fair value cannot 

be reliably measured (and derivatives linked 

to these instruments) should be measured at 

cost. Financial assets designated as hedged 

items are measured according to hedge 

accounting requirements; as a result, in fair 

value hedges, the carrying amount of the 

hedged item must be adjusted by the amount 

of the gain or loss attributable to the hedge 

risk (IAS 39.89).

Council Directive 86/635/EEC (BAD) is silent on the valuation 40 

of fi nancial liabilities.

See Section 2.2.2 for a description of the various portfolios. 41 

Financial instruments that must be classifi ed as “held for sale” 

in accordance with IFRS 5 are measured applying IAS 39 

measurement criteria.

To know more about the effective interest method, see IAS 39 42 

Appendix A (AG5 – AG8).

Subsequent measurement of fi nancial • 

liabilities (IAS 39.47) – All fi nancial 

liabilities must be measured at amortised 

cost using the effective interest method, 

except for fi nancial liabilities at fair value 

through profi t and loss, to be measured at 

fair value, and fi nancial liabilities that arise 

when a transfer of a fi nancial asset does not 

qualify for derecognition, which should be 

valued according to  IAS 39.29-31. Financial 

liabilities designated as hedged items are 

measured according to hedge accounting 

requirements; as a result, in fair value 

hedges, the carrying amount of the hedged 

item must be adjusted by the amount of the 

gain or loss attributable to the hedge risk 

(IAS 39.89).

As regards the valuation of investments in 

associates (entities over which the investor 

has signifi cant infl uence, e.g. 20% ownership, 

but which are neither subsidiaries nor joint 

ventures), IAS 28.13 requires the use of the 

so-called equity method for the consolidated 

statements, except when: (a) the investment 

meets the criteria to be classifi ed as a non-

current asset held for sale, or (b) the parent is 

not obliged to present consolidated fi nancial 

statements. IAS 31.30 allows the use of either 

proportionate consolidation or the equity 

method when accounting for interests in jointly 

controlled entities in the consolidated fi nancial 

statements. In the separate fi nancial statements, 

investments in subsidiaries, associates and 

jointly controlled entities are measured either at 

cost or at fair value according to IAS 39.

Tangible assets are at recognition measured 

at cost. Subsequently, an entity must choose 

either the cost model or the revaluation model 

as its accounting policy for property, plant and 

equipment, and must choose between the fair 

value model and the cost model for investment 

property. According to the cost model, after 

recognition an asset must be carried at its cost 

less any accumulated depreciation and any 

accumulated impairment losses (IAS 16.30). 

In the revaluation model, after recognition, an 

asset whose fair value can be measured reliably 

must be carried at a revalued amount, which is 

at its fair value at the date of the revaluation 

less any subsequent accumulated depreciation 

and subsequent accumulated impairment losses 

(IAS 16.31). On the other hand, entities may 

choose to measure the investment property at 

fair value or at cost. 

Intangible assets should initially be measured at 

cost, with the exception of intangible assets 

acquired in business combinations, e.g. mergers 

and acquisitions (at fair value) and goodwill (at 

cost, measured as the excess of the cost of the 

business combination over the acquirer’s interest 

in the fair value of the identifi able assets, net of 

liabilities and contingent liabilities) 

(IFRS 3.51b).43 Subsequently, entities may opt 

between the cost and the revaluation model.44  

An entity should measure the IAS category of 

“non-current assets (or disposal groups) classifi ed 

as held for sale” at the lower of its carrying 

amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-

current assets (or disposal groups) are classifi ed 

as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be 

mainly recovered through a sale transaction rather 

than through continuing use (IFRS 5). Non-

current assets (or disposal groups) generally arise 

from reorganisations or discontinued operations

(e.g. a bank decides to abandon its consumer 

credit business and wants to sell it to another 

bank). Nevertheless, fi nancial instruments that 

must be classifi ed as “held for sale” in accordance 

with IFRS 5 are measured in accordance with 

IAS 39.

When fi rst recorded, share capital repayable on 

demand (e.g. cooperative shares), which due to 

their contractual features (namely the ability of 

In the last version of IFRS 3, pending endorsement by the 43 

European Union, the way in which goodwill is measured at the 

acquisition date has changed. According to IFRS 3.32 (January 

2008), it must be measured as the excess of the amount paid 

at the time of the acquisition plus the amount of any non-

controlling interest over the net fair value of the identifi able 

assets and liabilities. To have a complete overview of the EU 
Commission “Regulations adopting IAS”, see  http://ec.europa.

the holder to claim redemption) are classifi ed 

as fi nancial liabilities, should be measured 

at fair value, which corresponds to not less 

than the maximum amount payable under the 

redemption provisions (IFRIC 2.10). The BSI 

Regulation requires “shares” of this kind to be 

treated statistically as deposits.

Although deposits should be recorded at 

nominal value in BSI statistics, the treatment 

of hybrid deposits (deposits with an 

embedded derivative) has so far represented 

a borderline case. The BSI manual has solved 

the problem by recommending a statistical 

classifi cation linked with the IAS 39 approach, 

as followed in FINREP. The link with

BSI statistics has been established as follows. 

Hybrid deposits are economically equivalent to 

the combination of a derivative contract and the 

pledging of a deposit as collateral. If the change 

in the price of the derivative is unfavourable for 

the depositor, part of the deposit will be used 

for a payment to the counterparty when the 

derivative contract is settled. This implies that 

the deposit represents cash collateral deposited 

in the bank and is freely available for on-

lending in the same way as “margin deposits”. 

Furthermore, while margins usually cover only 

the current price of the derivative (wholly or 

partially), the principal amount of deposits in 

hybrid contracts is usually well above this price.

As “margin deposits” are classifi ed as deposits in 

MFI balance sheets (BSI Regulation, Annex II 

part 2.9.c), hybrid deposits should follow the 

same approach for the sake of consistency. 

In principle, according to IAS 39.11, hybrid 

deposits should be separated into a host 

contract (the deposit or loan) and the embedded 

derivative. However, IAS 39.11A allows 

the entire hybrid deposit to be designated as 

a fi nancial instrument at fair value through 

profi t or loss (FV option). So in FINREP both 

treatments are accepted. In the fi rst case, when 

the hybrid deposit is separated, the host contract 

is classifi ed as a non-derivative fi nancial 

instrument (deposit or loan in FINREP) and the 

embedded derivative is classifi ed separately as a 

derivative. In the second case, the entire hybrid 

deposit is classifi ed as a fi nancial instrument 

(deposit or loan in FINREP). It should be noted 

that, according to a recent fact-fi nding exercise, 

the amounts involved are rather small (although 

they may be relevant in some categories and 

countries). Moreover, the implication of 

bringing the statistical treatment closer to the 

accounting/supervisory treatment is that hybrid 

deposits could be recorded at fair value, rather 

than at nominal value, as is in principle required 

for statistical purposes according to the BSI 

Regulation. If the amounts become signifi cant, 

they may need to be separately identifi ed in 

order to avoid any distortion to the statistical 

aggregates.

Conclusion: with the major exception of loans 
and deposits, for which nominal value reporting 

is mandatory under the BSI Regulation (even 

though central banks may allow reporting 

net of loan provisions), the valuation rules 

prescribed for the remaining instruments in the 

BSI Regulation are fl exible. In particular, for 

(holdings and issues of) securities, the non-

binding recommendation for statistical reporting 

is to use market/fair values, irrespective of 

whether the securities are held for trading or 

until maturity. However, those held to maturity 

are likely to be measured at amortised cost, 

in accordance with IAS 39. In legal terms, 

institutions required or allowed to use IAS/

IFRS and which report supervisory information 

on the basis of FINREP may use the same 

valuation concepts when reporting for BSI 

purposes, except for loans and deposits. For the 

latter instruments, some sort of reconciliation is 

possible between fair value or amortised cost 

and nominal value (see Annex 4.1). 

c) Time of recording

This subsection explains the criteria regarding 

time of recording applied in both IFRS 9/IAS 39 

(FINREP) and the BSI. The aim is to propose

a common approach, as input to the forthcoming 

changes to IFRS 9/IAS 39.

The time of recording in IFRS 9/IAS 39 

(FINREP) allows transactions in fi nancial assets 

to be recorded either on the “trade date” or on

BALANCE 

SHEET-FINREP
the “settlement date”. “Trade date” is defi ned 

as “the date that an entity commits itself to 
purchase or sell an asset” (IFRS 9.B3.1.5)
and “settlement date” as “the date that an asset 
is delivered to or by an entity” (IFRS 9.B3.1.6). 
IFRS 9.B3.1.3 requires the chosen method

to be “applied consistently for all purchases and 
sales of fi nancial assets that are classifi ed in 
accordance with this IFRS” (i.e. so-called IFRS 
9 portfolios). The criteria in IFRS 9 have been 

carried forward from IAS 39 (the predecessor 

standard on fi nancial instruments).

The option described above is kept in the 

FINREP Rev2 Guidelines. In particular, 

Chapter I.34 says that “FINREP does not 
prescribe which method is to be used. Credit 
institutions are free to choose unless their 
national supervisory authority requires 
a particular method as a matter of national 
harmonisation. CEBS may reconsider this issue 
in the future if practical experience indicates 
that the choice has a signifi cant impact on 
institutions’ fi nancial position or solvency”.

It should be noted that, for some transactions, 

the delivery is made on the “trade date”. This 

is normally the case for transactions in equity 

instruments on regulated stock exchanges. 

For other transactions, the delivery is made 

on the “payment date”. This is normally the 

case for transactions with debt instruments

(i.e. loans and debt securities).

The BSI Regulation does not address explicitly 

the time of recording of the transactions. 

However, the BSI Manual recommends the 

recording on the delivery date, in line with IAS/

IFRS. The Manual recognises that the trade 

date may be used if such a practice is followed 

in the accounting provisions, but if it leads to 

signifi cant distortions with reference to the 

settlement date, the national central bank should 

make adjustments to remove such distortions.

The CRD does not regulate the time of recording 

of the transactions. However, it establishes 

capital requirements for “settlement risk” and 

“free deliveries” that shed light on the way in 

which fi nancial instruments are transacted.  

On the one hand, “free deliveries” are 

transactions in which delivery and payment are 

not simultaneous; they include both transactions 

in which the payment has been made before the 

delivery of the fi nancial asset, and transactions 

in which the delivery has been made before 

receiving the payment.45 On the other hand, 

“settlement risk” capital requirements relate to 

transactions in which the agreed price is

not paid on the delivery due date. These capital 

requirements illustrate the importance of 

distinguishing between “trade date”, “delivery 

date” and “payment date”.

The capital treatment for “free deliveries” 

is basically established in the following table.

This means that, if the time of recording is 

the “trade date”, a fi nancial asset that is being

On the other hand, if the time of recording is the 

“delivery date”, no exposure would be recorded 

until the fi rst leg, because that is when the 

exposure appears. 

The current IFRS 9/IAS 39 (FINREP) criteria 

raise the following problems:

Options introduce complexity and reduce • 

comparability across entities.

Ideally, the choice of the “time of • 

recording” should depend on the terms 

of the transaction (i.e. when the ability 

to exercise the rights associated with the 

fi nancial assets is received/transferred) 

instead of the measurement applied for the 

instrument (as currently happens).

The approach chosen should depend on • 

the terms of the transaction instead of the 

measurement applied for the instrument

(as currently happens).

Conversely, the current MFI criteria recommend 

only one approach. For reconciliation purposes 

and to increase the data quality, thus it would be 

appropriate to follow the same approach in both 

MFI statistics and in FINREP.

Hence, to harmonise BSI statistics with the 

IFRS 9/IAS 39 (FINREP) criteria, the JEGR has 

proposed to its sponsors to record transactions 
at the date at which the ability to exercise the 
rights associated with the fi nancial assets 
transacted in is received/transferred (“delivery 
date”). The new BSI Manual already refl ects 
this proposal.

As illustrated in Table 2, the proposal is to 

select the most meaningful option from a 

fi nancial point of view: a transaction is recorded 

when the reporting entity is able to exercise

the associated rights. 

In principle, the cost of this change would 

be limited, as many Large Banking Groups 

(LBGs) are already operating in this way – 

see Box 1. 

Furthermore, for some transactions, the IFRS 9/

IAS 39 “trade date” is also the “settlement date”

and thus no option is available in practice.

This change would also bring the accounting 

of “free deliveries” closer to the capital 

requirements Regulation because it would 

avoid the recording of “free deliveries” not 

subject to capital charge. This change could 

coincide with the implementation of IFRS 9.

Conclusion: in order to reconcile the BSI 
and FINREP criteria, it is proposed to record 

transactions at the date in which the ability to 

exercise the rights associated with the fi nancial 

assets transacted in is received/transferred 

(“delivery date”). This recommendation has 

already been included in the new BSI Manual.

d) Treatment of accrued interest 

In statistical balance sheet reporting, MFIs 

must follow the general principle of accruals 

accounting, i.e. accrued interest should be subject 

to on-balance sheet recording as it accrues 

(accrual basis) rather than when it is actually paid 

or received (cash basis). To ensure the valuation 

of loans and deposits at nominal value, it is 

clearly stated in Annex II of the BSI Regulation 

that accrued interest on loans (deposits) should 

be reported under remaining assets (liabilities). 

Where interest accrued on balance sheet items 

other than loans and deposits should be recorded 

is less clear. The BSI Manual recommends 

recording accrued interest on a gross basis under 

“remaining assets/remaining liabilities”, with the 

exception of accrued interest that is intrinsic to 

the market price, for example on deep-discounted 

and zero coupon bonds, which MFIs may 

include in the value of the securities (i.e. with the 

underlying instrument). The MFS Guideline 46 

also requires national central banks to provide 

separate data on accrued interest where available. 

It may be worth noting that the preference of the 

ESA 95 is for accrued interest to be recorded 

with the fi nancial instrument to which it relates 

(paragraph 5.130). 

Although also requesting accrual accounting, the 

IAS/IFRS do not give a clear-cut answer on 

whether unpaid accrued interest should be 

accounted for in a separate “caption” of the 

balance sheet or be included in the fi nancial 

instrument to which it relates.47 In the revised 

FINREP framework, it was decided that unpaid

Box 1 

SURVEY ON THE TIMING OF RECORDING

In order to assess the cost of a proposal to reconcile different approaches to the timing of 

recording, the JEGR checked the current practice of a sample of 33 large banking groups (LBGs) 

with headquarters in nine EU countries. This check is based on information contained in banks’ 

published fi nancial statements. 

The outcome of the survey shows that the fi rst, second and fourth proposals (regarding loans, 

foreign exchange deposits and equity instruments) are broadly in line with current practice, as the 

“delivery date” approach is followed by two thirds of these LBGs. It should be noted that only 

half of them disclose information on the treatment of transactions in foreign currency deposits. 

The practice followed in accounting for debt securities (third proposal) is more diverse, as only 

50% of them follow the proposed approach. Detailed country replies are available upon request.

accrued interest should be included in the 

category of fi nancial instrument to which it relates 

(i.e. not in a separate “caption”). On the income 

statement, interest income and interest expenses 

relating to fi nancial instruments held for trading 

and fi nancial instruments designated at fair value 

through profi t or loss may be reported either as 

part of interest income and expense

(“clean pricing”) or under net gains (losses) from 

these categories of instruments (“dirty pricing”). 

National supervisory authorities may permit or 

require credit institutions to report the amounts of 

interest income and interest expenses separately.

Conclusion: BSI and FINREP requirements 
are consistent as regards the need to record 

interest on an accruals basis, but differ in 

their requirement regarding the classifi cation

of accrued interest not yet paid. The BSI 

Regulation requires accrued interest on loans and 

deposits to be reported under remaining assets/

liabilities, whereas in FINREP accrued interest 

is recorded with the underlying instrument. 

However, since the MFS Guideline requires 

accrued interest to be separately identifi ed 

where available, the amounts can be reconciled 

with those recorded in FINREP.

e) Recognition and derecognition 

The requirements concerning reporting of 

securitisations in the BSI Regulation 

(ECB/2008/32), and in complementary reporting 

by fi nancial vehicle corporations (FVCs) under 

Regulation ECB/2008/30, are designed to 

prevent loans which are the subject of 

securitisations from dropping out of the 

recording, or being recorded twice, and – where 

they are removed from the balance sheet of the 

originating MFI – to ensure that relevant 

information about them subsequently is retained 

as it would have been if they had remained on 

the balance sheet of the originator.48 

The BSI Regulation states how cases of 

securitisation should be recorded, rather 

than setting rules and specifi c approaches 

for recognition/derecognition. According 

to Regulation ECB/2008/32, for data up 

to November 2009, the general rules in 

Article 7 applied (i.e. the reference to the 

national transposition of Council Directive 

86/635/EEC of 8 December 1986 on the 

annual accounts and consolidated accounts 

of banks and other fi nancial institutions, as 

well as in any other international standards).

As a consequence, depending on national 

practices, the derecognition of assets was linked 

to the transfer of ownership or to the transfer of 

all the risks and rewards of ownership. 

For data starting in December 2009, the BSI 

Regulation allows central banks to refer to either 

the IAS/IFRS approach or the local GAAPs 

when dealing with (de)recognition of assets, 

while specifying some reporting requirements 

for loan securitisations and other loan transfers. 

In particular the Regulation states that: 

“ – derecognition means the removal of a 
loan or part thereof from the stocks (...), 
including its removal due to the application 
of a derogation referred to in Article 8(6)” 
(Annex 1 Part 6);

“ – derogations may be granted in respect of 
the statistical reporting of loans that are 
disposed of by means of a securitisation. 
MFIs applying the IAS 39 or similar national 
accounting rules may be allowed by their 
NCB to exclude from the stocks (…) any loans 
disposed of by means of a securitisation in 
accordance with national practice, provided 
that this practice is applied by all resident 
MFIs” (Article 8.6);

A brief explanation of why data on securitisation are necessary 48 

for monetary policy analysis may be helpful. In the absence of 

further information, removal of loans from the MFI balance 

sheet (“traditional” securitisation with derecognition) will give 

the impression that loans have been repaid, whereas in reality 

the borrower has experienced no withdrawal of credit. In 

traditional securitisation without derecognition, however, and 

in synthetic securitisation, the loans remain on the balance sheet 

of the originating MFI. Because the matter is rather complex 

(traditional securitisations with or without derecognition, 

synthetic securitisations, the partner FVC resident or not resident, 

the originating MFI continuing to administer the loans even if 

they are no longer on its balance sheet, or ceasing to administer 

them), the reporting requirements are complicated in detail, 

although their purpose is clear.

“loans disposed of during a warehousing  –
phase in a securitisation (when the 
securitisation is not yet completed because 
securities or similar instruments have not 
yet been issued to investors) are treated 
as if they were already securitised”
(Annex 1 Part 6).   

Moreover, the BSI Regulation requires the 

following separate statistical data in order 

to make a bridge between different national 

accounting practices: 

net fl ows of loans securitised or otherwise  –
transferred: transactions with impact on 
reported loan stocks calculated as disposal 
minus acquisitions;

net fl ows of loans securitised or otherwise  –
transferred: transactions without impact on 
reported loan stocks calculated as disposal 
minus acquisitions;

in the case of MFIs applying the IAS 39  –

or similar rules: outstanding amounts of 
securitised loans not derecognised.

Under IAS/IFRS, the (de)recognition rules are 

quite complex, as described in Box 2. Since the 

IAS/IFRS rules (specifi cally, IAS 39) state that, 

in case of partial transfer of risks/rewards, the 

securitised loans should not be derecognised, 

if these rules were applied in the statistical 

framework securitised loans would be booked 

both in the balance sheet of the originating MFI 

and in that of the purchasing FVC. To avoid 

double-counting, the BSI Regulation requires 

the separate identifi cation of loans securitised 

via FVCs but which nevertheless remain on 

the MFI’s balance sheet, together with the 

counterpart liability (which refl ects the payment 

that the originating MFI will have received for 

the loans, despite retaining them on its balance 

sheet). National central banks may ask credit 

institutions to follow the same IAS 39-based 

approach as in FINREP for their statistical 

reporting, in order to reduce reporting costs. 

FINREP Table 12 (Transfer of fi nancial 

assets) provides information on the carrying 

amount of fi nancial assets entirely recognised 

on the balance sheet, with assets securitised 

(but retained on the balance sheet) as an“of 

which” item. In particular, Table 12A is used 

to report transferred fi nancial assets part or 

all of which do not qualify for derecognition

(see IAS 39.15-37), and fi nancial assets 

entirely derecognised for which the entity 

retains servicing rights. To provide a link 

with COREP, the table includes a column 

for fi nancial assets that are derecognised for 

capital adequacy purposes. The associated 

liabilities should be reported in this template 

according to the portfolio in which the related 

transferred fi nancial assets are included (not 

according to the portfolio in which they are 

included on the liability side). Table 12B 

includes the carrying amount of all fi nancial 

assets pledged as collateral for liabilities 

or contingent liabilities by the reporting 

entity. It includes pledges made through the 

transfer of the fi nancial asset involved when 

the transferee has the right to sell or repledge 

the collateral (see IAS 39.37(a)), such as in 

“repos”, pledges made through transfers in 

which the transferee does not have the right 

to sell or repledge the collateral, such as in a 

securitisation, and other pledges that do not 

imply the transfer of collateral, such as issues 

of covered bonds.

This information is broken down by IFRS 

portfolio and by instruments. The data on 

securitised loans can therefore be linked 

with the BSI item “outstanding amount of 

securitised loans not derecognised”. The 

only differences are 1) that no information on 

securitised loans for the IFRS portfolio “held to 

maturity” is separately available in FINREP and 

2) the valuation, since FINREP data are net of 

valuation adjustments (specifi c allowances), 

while BSI data are supposedly reported gross 

of such adjustments, that is, at nominal value. 

The link between FINREP and BSI can be 

summarised as follows:

Box 2 

IAS 39 RULES FOR THE (DE)RECOGNITION OF ASSETS/LIABILITIES  

IAS 39 (paragraphs 14 to 42) describes in detail the conditions that should be fulfi lled for 

recognition and derecognition of fi nancial assets and liabilities. Due to the complexity of the 

conditions for derecognition of fi nancial assets, IAS 39.AG36 provides an explanatory fl ow 

chart and the FINREP framework contains a table (Table 12) for collecting detailed information 

on transfers of fi nancial assets.

In addition to the “regular way purchase or sale of a fi nancial asset”, which should be recognised 

and derecognised using the trading date or the settlement date (see Section 2.3.3), fi nancial 

assets should be derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash fl ows from a fi nancial 

asset expire or when the fi nancial asset is deemed to be transferred, and the transfer qualifi es for 

derecognition.

An institution is deemed to have transferred an asset if, and only if, it either: a) transfers the 

contractual rights to receive the cash fl ows arising from the fi nancial asset, or b) retains the 

contractual rights to receive these cash fl ows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay them to 

one or more recipients in an arrangement that meets certain conditions (specifi ed in IAS 39.19). 

The transfer of a fi nancial asset qualifi es for derecognition when substantially all the risks and 

rewards of owning it are also transferred. In this case, any fi nancial assets or liabilities created or 

retained because of the transfer should be treated separately. If, however, substantially all the risks 

and rewards of ownership of a fi nancial asset are retained, the entity must continue to recognise 

the fi nancial asset in its balance sheet.1 If the risks and rewards of ownership of a fi nancial asset 

are neither transferred nor retained, the entity should derecognise the fi nancial asset if it has not 

retained control over it and keep it in the balance sheet to the extent that it has not relinquished 

control (IAS 39.20.c).2 When an entity continues to recognise a transferred fi nancial asset, the 

entity also recognises an associated liability; the net carrying amount of the fi nancial asset and 

the associated liability refl ects the rights and obligations retained by the entity.

The rules presented in the previous paragraphs for derecognition of a fi nancial asset under IAS 

may apply either to only a part of a fi nancial asset (or group of fi nancial assets) or to its entirety. 

It should apply to only a part of it if that part comprises: a) specifi cally identifi ed cash fl ows 

(e.g. all interest cash fl ows), b) a fully proportionate (pro rata) share of the cash fl ows (e.g. 90% 

of all cash fl ows), or c) a fully proportionate (pro rata) share of specifi cally identifi ed cash fl ows 

(e.g. 90% of all interest cash fl ows). In all other cases, the rules for derecognition apply to the 

fi nancial asset (or group of fi nancial assets) in its entirety.3 Partial derecognition of fi nancial 

assets under IAS 39 leads to a reduction of the outstanding nominal amount.

A fi nancial liability (or a part of a fi nancial liability) should be removed from the balance sheet 

when, and only when, it is extinguished, i.e. when the obligation specifi ed in the contract is 

discharged or cancelled, or expires (IAS 39.39-42).

1 See IAS 39.21-22 for more details on how to evaluate the degree to which risks and rewards are transferred.

2 IAS 39.23 elaborates on the concept of control.

3 For example, when the rights to 90% of the cash fl ows from a group of receivables are transferred, but the entity provides a guarantee 

to compensate the buyer for any credit losses, the rules for derecognition should apply to the group of receivables in its entirety.

to the EBA Secretariat.

Conclusion: For BSI data (de)recognition 
practice may now follow either the IAS/IFRS 

approach or local GAAPs. However, detailed 

statistical reporting requirements enable the 

data derived from the different accounting 

approaches to be bridged.

f) Netting (offsetting) arrangements

In terms of netting (offsetting) arrangements, 

Article 7 of the BSI Regulation states that 

without prejudice to the netting practices 

prevailing in the national GAAP, all fi nancial 

assets and liabilities must be reported on a gross 

basis for monetary statistics purposes. 

The BSI Manual states that the principle of 

gross reporting should be applied, in particular, 

to loans and deposits. Gross reporting means 

(for example) that a loan extended to a customer 

must not be offset against a deposit held by the 

same customer. Previous BSI guidance 49 stated 

that as an exception, loans/deposits could 

be presented in net terms if credit and debit 

balances had identical features, i.e. were vis-

à-vis the same customer (resident in the same 

territory of the reporting MFI), were in the 

same currency, and the same original maturity, 

and the right of set-off was enforceable by 

law.50 This condition was very restrictive and 

in practice permitted almost no netting. In the 

BSI Manual, this possibility of netting has 

been discarded; accordingly, netting of loans/

deposits is never allowed. The only exception 

to the rule of gross recording concerns the 

treatment of holdings by an MFI of shares and 

debt securities which it has itself issued, where 

own holdings should be deducted from the 

amount outstanding. 

As prescribed by IAS 32.42 51 and consequently 

by FINREP, a fi nancial asset and a fi nancial 

liability are to be offset and the net amount 

presented in the balance sheet when, and only 

when, an entity: (a) currently has a legally 

enforceable right to set off the recognised 

amounts (i.e. same condition as hitherto in BSI 

statistics); and (b) intends either to settle on a 

net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the 

liability simultaneously. In accounting for a 

transfer of a fi nancial asset that does not qualify 

for derecognition, the entity must not offset the 

transferred asset and the associated liability. 

IAS 32.43 elaborates further: the presentation of 

fi nancial assets and fi nancial liabilities must be 

on a net basis when net recording refl ects an 

entity’s expected future cash fl ows from settling 

two or more separate fi nancial instruments. In 

other circumstances, fi nancial assets and 

fi nancial liabilities are presented separately from 

each other consistently with their characteristics 

as resources or obligations of the entity. 

Upon fulfi lment of the two criteria defi ned in 

IAS 32.42, an entity that undertakes a number 

of transactions in fi nancial instruments with a 

single counterparty may enter into a “master 

netting arrangement” with that counterparty. 

Such an agreement provides for a single net 

settlement of all fi nancial instruments covered 

by the agreement in the event of default on, or 

termination of, any one contract (IAS 32.50). 

In “Guidance notes to the Regulation ECB/2001/13 on the MFI 49 

balance sheet statistics”.

Enforceable by law means that the set-off arrangement would 50 

be enforceable in the relevant national jurisdiction in case of 

default, liquidation or bankruptcy of the customer or liquidation 

of the reporting institution.

IAS 1.32-35 establishes as a general principle that assets and 51 

liabilities, and incomes and expenses, cannot be offset, unless 

allowed by another IFRS.



42
ECB

MFI balance sheet and interest rate statistics and EBA guidelines on FINREP and COREP/Large Exposures

March 2012

IAS 32.33 states that an entity which reacquires 

its own equity instruments (“treasury shares”) 

must deduct them from equity issued and 

separately disclose them in fi nancial statements. 

Along the same lines, IAS 39.AG 58 states that 

if an issuer of a debt instrument repurchases that 

instrument, the debt is extinguished even if the 

issuer is a market maker or intends to resell the 

instrument in the near future. This is the same as 

the treatment of “own holdings” in MFI balance 

sheet statistics.

When a bank securitises a loan through an 

FVC but does not derecognise the loan for 

accounting purposes, a new liability is recorded 

for the compensation received. If the bank buys 

securities issued by the FVC to fi nance the 

acquisition of the loans, under BSI rules the 

bank (MFI) must recognise these securities as 

an asset. IAS 39, on the other hand, requires 

the bank to offset the securities against the 

liability to avoid the duplication of assets. 

This treatment is different from the accounting 

treatment applied to the acquisition of own debt 

instruments as explained above.

Conclusion: The rules defi ned in the IAS/IFRS 
for balance sheet recognition on a gross basis 

are in line with the requirements for monetary 

statistics reporting, except in very limited 

circumstances (the right of set-off is enforceable 

by law) where net recording is allowed under 

FINREP. 

g) Impairment of assets (basis of recording)

As mentioned in Section 2.3.3, the BSI 

Regulation requires loans to be recorded at 

nominal value gross of all related provisions 

(impairment losses or amounts recorded in 

allowance accounts). Thus, credit losses are 

generally not recorded through provisions 

or allowances. Central banks may, however, 

allow the reporting of loans net of provisions, 

provided that such reporting practice is applied 

by all resident reporting agents and is necessary 

to maintain continuity in the statistical valuation 

of loans with the data reported for periods 

prior to January 2005. Loans recorded gross of 

provisions should continue to be so recorded 

until the loans are written off or written down 

as partly or totally unrecoverable (impaired), at 

which point the loans are fully (written off) or 

partly (written down) removed from the balance 

sheet. As some countries may record loans net of 

specifi c provisions, while others record them at 

full value until written off or written down, there 

may be some discrepancies across countries 

arising from the timing of derecognition.

IAS 39.59 specifi es the conditions for the 

identifi cation of impaired assets and the 

recognition of impairment losses.52 There must 

be objective evidence of impairment as a result 

of one or more (loss) events that occurred after 

the initial recognition of the asset, and that event 

(or events) must have an impact that can be 

reliably estimated. Several examples of loss 

events are provided in the standard: the breach 

of a contract, such as a default or delinquency in 

interest or principal payments, is the most 

common and evident.

For fi nancial assets carried at amortised cost 

(i.e. loans and receivables or held-to-maturity 

investments), if there is objective evidence that 

an impairment loss has occurred, the amount of 

the loss is measured as the difference between 

the asset’s carrying amount and the present 

value of estimated future cash fl ows (excluding 

future credit losses that have not been incurred). 

The carrying amount of the asset is then reduced 

either directly or through use of an allowance 

account, and the amount of the loss must be 

recognised in profi t and loss (IAS 39.63). 

In other words, the balance sheet values of 

loans and receivables are measured net of 

impairment losses, providing a proxy for market 

value. The impairment loss is deducted from 

the loan directly or through the use of an 

allowance account.

For fi nancial assets measured at fair value 

through profi t or loss, impairment losses are 

recognised implicitly in the fair value accounting. 

In this context, impairment losses are equivalent to the amount 52 

of allowances and write downs and write offs, i.e. the amount 

eliminated from the balance sheet and recognised directly in 

profi t or loss.

2 STATISTICAL 

BALANCE 

SHEET-FINREP
The accumulated credit losses implicit in 

changes in fair value must be disclosed in the 

annual accounts in the case of loans designated 

at fair value, and FINREP also requires that 

this amount be disclosed for fi nancial assets 

classifi ed in the trading category.

Conclusion: In the BSI reporting scheme, 
loans should be reported gross of all 

impairment allowances (though there are 

permitted exceptions), whereas in FINREP 

they are reported in the balance sheet net of 

the accumulated impairment losses. Hence, 

the two reporting frameworks may deviate as 

regards the recording of impaired loans, but 

reconciliation at the conceptual level is possible 

(see Section 2.3.3 and Annex 4).

2.3.3 BREAKDOWNS

This subsection covers the four main balance 

sheet breakdowns in BSI and FINREP, namely: 

a) residency and geographical breakdown, 

b) counterpart sector breakdown, c) maturity 

breakdown and d) instruments and products 

breakdown.

a) Residency and geographical breakdown 

The compilation of monetary aggregates 

for the euro area requires MFIs to identify 

counterparties resident in the euro area who are 

in the money holding sectors (see Section 2.1.1). 

Thus MFIs resident in the euro area are required 

to report positions vis-à-vis other residents of 

the euro area broken down by sector. 

The residency concept in the BSI Regulation 

follows the ESA 95, which in turn provides 

the methodological basis for the compilation 

of macroeconomic statistical aggregates based 

on the residency principle. In a nutshell, the 

residency principle is based on the concepts 

of economic territory and centre of economic 

interest. Generally, an institutional unit is 

deemed resident in an economic territory, which 

consists of a geographic territory administered 

by a government, when it engages and intends 

to continue engaging in economic activities 

and transactions on a signifi cant scale in that 

territory. In essence, an institutional unit is a 

resident of the economy in which it is ordinarily 

located. The new statistical standards (the 

SNA 2008, ESA 2010, the 6th edition of the 

IMF’s Balance of Payments and International 
Investment Position Manual) and the BSI 
Regulation, however, make clear that an entity 

is resident in the country in which it is registered 

or authorised, even in the absence of a physical 

presence there.

In BSI statistics, the breakdown by residence is: 

domestic, resident elsewhere in the euro area, 

and resident in the rest of the world (i.e., outside 

the euro area). Additionally, the Regulation 

requires country-by-country information on 

some positions with counterparties resident in 

EU countries. 

In FINREP, the non-core information provides a 

geographical breakdown of assets and liabilities 

by residence of the counterparty as follows: 

domestic, resident elsewhere in the euro area, 

resident in other EU countries, and resident in 

the rest of the world. 53 The breakdown is 

required by instrument and portfolio but not by 

counterpart sector.

Conclusion: The residency concepts in the 
BSI Regulation and the FINREP Guidelines on 

geographical breakdown are consistent. 

b) Counterpart sector breakdown

The ESA 95 groups institutional units resident 

in an economy (usually a country or a group 

of countries e.g. the euro area) into fi ve 

mutually exclusive institutional sectors (non-

fi nancial corporations, fi nancial corporations, 

general government, households and 

non-profi t institutions serving households) 

based on their principal functions, behaviour 

and objectives. Financial corporations 

and general government are divided into 

sub-sectors. Non-residents of the economy 

For clarity, “domestic” means the country of the national 53 

supervisory authority receiving the report. When debt 

securities issued by the reporting entity cannot be allocated by 

the geographical area of the residency of the holder without 

incurring undue costs they should, by convention, be classifi ed 

geographically according to the residence of the market in which 

they are traded.

comprise the rest of the world, and transactions 

and positions of residents with them are 

recorded in the rest of the world column. The 

BSI Regulation follows this sectorisation, 

except that households and non-profi t

between money-issuing and money-holding

other fi nancial corporations, non-fi nancial

become easier under the revised FINREP, 

and past JEGR recommendations related to 

counterpart breakdown have allowed almost 

full reconciliation (the exception is the FINREP 

sector “Other fi nancial corporations” which may 

include some MFIs along with entities that meet 

the BSI defi nition of OFIs). 

Table 5 also provides a reconciliation with 

the CRD exposure classes. It may be useful 

to explain that the CRD has two approaches to 

classifying exposure classes. In the Internal 

Ratings Based (IRB) approach, the banking 

exposures are classifi ed in one of the “exposures 

classes” included in the last column of Table 5. 

In the standardised approach, in addition to 

these “classes”, the exposures can also be 

assigned to the following items depending on 

the circumstances of the book entries: “secured 

on real estate property”, “past due items”, 

“regulatory high-risk categories”, “covered 

bonds”, “securitisation positions”, “short-term 

claims on institutions and corporate”, “CIU” 

and “other items”. Each exposure (or part of 

them, where appropriate) must be assigned to 

only one of the exposure classes. This poses a 

diffi culty for aggregations at the sector level, 

e.g. for macroprudential analysis purposes, 

because if, for instance, there is a need to assess 

the total amount of banks’ exposures to the retail 

sector, the COREP data on exposures would 

exclude those that are recorded as “securitised 

on real estate property”, “past due” and 

“securitisation positions”, etc. A reconciliation is 

therefore necessary.

As noted earlier, whereas the BSI sector 

breakdown applies to the classifi cation of 

units resident in the euro area (with a separate, 

less detailed, classifi cation for non-euro area 

residents), the FINREP counterpart breakdown 

is used in the classifi cation of all institutions 

with which the credit institution has positions 

(that is to say, a non-resident counterpart would 

be classifi ed indistinguishably with similar 

resident counterparts). 

In some countries, bridging the different 

counterpart sector breakdowns is important for 

the banking industry, since the management 

of these different datasets is considered costly 

for banks. In such countries, reconciling these 

different datasets is a signifi cant element in 

reducing credit institutions’ reporting burden. 

Conversely, in other countries, national 

authorities have developed different tools to 

overcome these diffi culties. 

Conclusion: The revised FINREP has removed 
most differences from the BSI in the defi nition 

of counterpart sectors. In particular, a bridging 

template for counterparty breakdowns allows 

reconciliation between the two reporting 

schemes for loans and for advances and deposits 

in selected templates. The CRD exposure 

classes have also been linked, but in practice 

a numerical reconciliation may be diffi cult to 

achieve, except for IRB banks. A reconciliation 

is therefore necessary, not least for the purpose 

of a consistent macroprudential analysis.

c) Maturity breakdown

The BSI Regulation requires a breakdown of 

positions mainly according to original maturity, 

i.e. the maturity at inception or at issue, with the 

exception of deposits redeemable at notice, 

where period of notice is the relevant maturity 

concept. 54 The original maturity cut-offs are 

considered to provide a good indication of the 

nature of the fi nancial instrument and the 

intentions of the holder; the defi nitions of the 

various monetary aggregates are based partly on 

original maturity. The focus in the ESA 95 is on 

the original (rather than residual) maturity. On 

the liability side, the cut-offs for relevant deposits 

and debt securities issued are 1 and 2 years’ 

maturity at issue or 3 months’ notice (some 

deposits only). On the asset side, the cut-offs are 

1 and 2 years’ maturity at issue for holdings of 

debt securities and 1 and 5 years’ original 

maturity for loans. The new BSI Regulation also 

requires breakdowns by remaining maturity 

(1, 2 years) and rate reset interval (12, 24 months) 

for euro-denominated loans to non-fi nancial 

corporations and households.

Part 2 of Annex II of the BSI Regulation provides a defi nition of 54 

the maturity concepts used throughout the Regulation.

BALANCE 

SHEET-FINREP
For the purpose of liquidity risk analysis, 

IFRS 7.39 requires credit institutions to disclose 

the remaining contractual maturities of liabilities. 

Credit institutions are free to decide on the time 

bands, but IFRS 7 (Appendix B) provides an 

example (up to 1 month, between 1 and 3 months, 

between 3 months and 1 year, between 1 and 

5 years, over 5 years). This breakdown in appendix 

B of IFRS 7 is for guidance purposes only and is 

currently not foreseen in FINREP, although the 

draft CRD IV amendments request that EBA 

develop reporting standards for liquidity data to 

be in force from 2013. It is widely recognised that 

for fi nancial supervision and fi nancial stability 

analysis, residual maturity (i.e. remaining maturity 

at balance sheet date) is the relevant concept, as it 

provides a better framework for risk assessment. 

This is also the maturity concept used throughout 

the CRD for credit risk weighting. 

Conclusion: BSI requirements specify the 
classifi cation of fi nancial assets and liabilities, 

mainly according to their original maturity, but 

for some breakdowns also according to residual 

maturity. FINREP has no requirements in terms 

of original or residual maturity breakdowns, 

although IFRS 7 requires institutions to disclose 

remaining (residual) contractual maturities of 

liabilities (but time bands are not standardised).  

Moreover, it is worth noting in that regard that 

the future FINEP may be expanded to cover 

liquidity data. 

d) Instruments and products

One of the main elements in the defi nition of 

the euro area monetary aggregates and their 

counterparts is the selection of the MFI liabilities 

and assets (fi nancial instruments). The various 

euro area monetary aggregates differ with regard 

to the degree of liquidity (assessed on the basis 

of the criteria of transferability, convertibility, 

price certainty and marketability) of the MFI 

liabilities they include. Hence, one of the main 

BSI requirements is the breakdown of MFI 

liabilities by instrument. The counterparts to 

broad money (M3) comprise the non-monetary 

liabilities of MFIs and their assets (also broken 

down by instrument), arranged in an analytically 

useful way. 

IAS 39 requires fi nancial assets and liabilities 

to be grouped in “portfolios”, but without 

prescribing a rigid format for the disclosure. In 

particular, IFRS 7.8 allows credit institutions to 

report fi nancial instruments by IAS 39 portfolios 

either in the balance sheet (as in FINREP) or in 

the notes. When IAS 39 portfolios are disclosed 

in the notes, IFRS 7.6 requires an analysis by 

class of fi nancial instrument with suffi cient 

information to permit reconciliation with the 

line items in the balance sheet. Thus, IFRS 

7 allows a classifi cation by class of fi nancial 

instruments and the requirements applicable 

to determine these classes (IFRS 7.B1-B2) 

constrain the way in which fi nancial instruments 

are presented in the balance sheet. Under 

FINREP, this constraint has been solved as 

follows: at the fi rst level of the FINREP balance 

sheet, the information is organised by portfolio, 

and only at a second level are data broken down 

by fi nancial instrument. Annex 4.3 provides in 

a tabular format the equivalence between the 

MFIs’ main balance sheet items, as defi ned in the 

BSI Regulation, and the FINREP requirements. 

FINREP Table 6.A introduces a “breakdown of 

loans and advances by product” – with detailed 

instructions in the Guidelines – that is currently 

referenced mainly to IFRS 7.IG 21.55 Insofar as 

IAS/IFRS do not include defi nitions for all the 

items used, 56 this “breakdown of loans and 

advances by product” could also be linked to 

Annex II of the BSI Regulation (see Annex 4.2). 

Further links regarding the instrument 

“shares and other equity” are described in 

sub-section 2.3.16.

Conclusion: It is possible to set up a bridge 
between the instruments requested in the two 

IFRS IG 7.21 states the following: “55 Paragraph 36 requires an 

entity to disclose information about its exposure to credit risk 

by class of fi nancial instrument. Financial instruments in the 

same class share economic characteristics with respect to the 

risk being disclosed (in this case, credit risk). For example, an 

entity might determine that residential mortgages, unsecured 

consumer loans, and commercial loans each have different 

economic characteristics.”

IAS/IFRS provides defi nitions only for two items, fi nance 56 

leases and reverse repurchase loans. However, the link between 

the revised FINREP framework and the MFI Regulation has 

become explicit.

reporting schemes despite some differences 

in their balance sheet structure. This bridging 

may be facilitated if the IAS/IFRS accounting 

fl exibility is used to bring it as close to the BSI 

requirements as is considered appropriate, with 

the main exception of IAS categories “Non-

current assets held for sale” and “Discontinued 

operations” (see sub-section 2.3.4.b below). 

Moreover, the FINREP Guidelines on breakdown 

by type of loan include a link to some statistical 

defi nitions.

2.3.4 TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC ITEMS

This sub-section covers the treatment of four 

specifi c items in BSI and FINREP, namely: 

a) collateral and guarantees, b) non-current 

assets held for sale and discontinued operations, 

c) preference shares (liabilities side) and 

d) shares and other equity (assets side).

a) Collateral and guarantees

For each type of loan to non-fi nancial 

corporations (NFCs) and for loans to households 

(HHs) broken down by purpose (consumer 

credit, house purchase, and other lending), the 

BSI Regulation requires the amount secured by 

real estate collateral as defi ned in the CRD with 

an outstanding loan/collateral ratio of 1 or below 

1 to be reported. Under FINREP, Table 6.A has 

a breakdown of loans and advances by product 

and the item “mortgage loans (real estate 

collateralised loans)” includes any loan formally 

backed by real estate collateral independently of 

its loan-to-value ratio.

In addition, Table 6.B provides information 

on the carrying amount of loans and advances 

backed by pledges of collateral (real estate 

and/or other assets) or by fi nancial guarantees. 

The maximum collateral/guarantee that can 

be considered cannot exceed the amount 

of the related loan. 57 Collateralised “loans 

and advances” are broken down into mortgage 

loans (real estate collateralised loans: 

residential/commercial), other collateralised 

loans (cash/rest) and fi nancial guarantees.

Conclusion: The BSI framework uses the CRD 
defi nition of real estate collateral with a loan-to-

value ratio of 1 or below. In FINREP, mortgage 

loans include any real estate collateralised loans 

regardless of the loan-to-value ratio. BSI real 

estate collateralised loans are therefore a subset 

of FINREP mortgage loans.

b) Non-current assets held for sale 

and discontinued operations

In the BSI framework, loans and holdings of 

debt securities and equity instruments must be 

classifi ed in the relevant instrument category 

whether or not they meet the criteria in IFRS 5 

to be classifi ed as “held for sale”.

IFRS 5.38 requires an entity to present a 

non-current asset held for sale and the assets of 

a disposal group 58 separately from other assets 

in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a 

disposal group must also be presented separately 

from other liabilities in the balance sheet. 

In FINREP, non-current assets held for sale and 

the assets of a disposal group are presented 

together in a single line item; the liabilities of a 

disposal group are also presented together in 

another line item. 

Conclusion: Bridging fi nancial instruments in 
BSI and FINREP remains diffi cult owing to the 

IFRS presentation of non-current assets held for 

sale and assets of a disposal group in a single 

line item (including fi nancial assets), together 

with the presentation of liabilities of a disposal 

group in another line item (including fi nancial 

liabilities).

c) Preference shares (liabilities side)

The FINREP Guidelines and the BSI Regulation 

do not provide many details on the treatment of 

preference shares on the liabilities side of the 

balance sheet.

For example, if a loan of €1 million is covered by a pledge 57 

of securities with a fair value of €1.5 million, the maximum 

collateral that can be considered is €1 million.

A “disposal group” is a group of assets, possibly with some 58 

associated liabilities, which an entity intends to dispose of 

in a single transaction. The measurement basis required for 

non-current assets classifi ed as held for sale is applied to the 

group as a whole, and any resulting impairment loss reduces the 

carrying amount of the non-current assets in the disposal group 

in the order of allocation required by IAS 36.

BALANCE 

SHEET-FINREP
According to IAS 32, these instruments should 

be treated as debt or equity depending on 

certain criteria. In the BSI reporting, however, 

these instruments may be recorded as “capital 

and reserves”. It is therefore useful to ensure 

a correct classifi cation of these instruments 

in both reporting frameworks. If a different 

treatment is not justifi ed, reconciliation may be 

possible. A preference share is a special type 

of share that may have any combination of 

features not possessed by common stocks. The 

following features are usually associated with 

preference shares: 

Preference in • dividends;

Preference in assets in the event of • 

liquidation;

Convertible into common stock;• 

Callable at the option of the issuer;• 

Non-voting.• 

A preference share can either be cumulative or 

non-cumulative: a cumulative preferred share 

requires that if a company fails to pay any 

dividend, or pays an amount below the stated 

rate, it must make up for it at a later stage. 

The BSI Regulation defi nes capital and reserves 

as “the amounts arising from the issue of equity 
capital … representing for the holder property 
rights in the MFI and generally an entitlement 
to a share in its profi ts and to a share in its own 
funds in the event of liquidation”. No specifi c 
guidance on the treatment of preference shares 

is given. However, the term “equity capital” 

points towards Article 22 of Council Directive 

86/635/EEC (so-called Bank Accounts 

Directive, or BAD), which makes no distinction 

between common shares and preference shares. 

This means that preference shares, irrespective 

of their different rights, may be regarded as part 

of the item “capital and reserves”.

According to Article 22 of the BAD, “subscribed 

capital” comprises “all amounts, regardless of 
their actual designations, which, in accordance 
with the legal structure of the institution 
concerned, are regarded under national law as 
equity capital”. Thus, in the BAD defi nition of 
subscribed capital adopted for BSI purposes, 

“capital and reserves” follows a legal approach 

focused on whether the instruments issued are 

regarded as capital under national law (without 

regarding the economic rights associated to 

then). This means that preference shares with 

economic rights that are different from those 

of the ordinary shares (i.e. non-discretionary 

remuneration, mandatory redemption or both) 

would be regarded as part of the item “capital 

and reserves”, if so allowed or requested by 

national legislation. 

In contrast to this legal approach, the second part 

of the BSI defi nition (representing an entitlement 

to a share in its profi ts and to a share in its own 

funds in the event of liquidation) indicates a 

need to perform an analysis of the economic 

right associated with these instruments. This 

approach is also hinted at in Annex II, Part 2.9.d) 

of the BSI Regulation, when it is established 

that shares issued are classifi ed as “Deposits” 

instead of as “Capital and reserves” if “there is a 
debtor-creditor economic relationship between 
the issuing MFI and the holder (regardless of 
any property rights in these shares)”. Thus, 
all instruments that entitle to a share in profi ts 

(i.e. with discretionary remuneration) and to a 

share in its own funds in the event of liquidation 

(i.e. non-mandatorily redeemable) would 

be BSI “capital and reserves”. In this case, 

capital and reserves would follow an economic 

approach focused on the economic rights 

associated with the instruments (without regard 

for whether they are “capital” under national law). 

This means that only preference shares with 

rights that are similar to those of ordinary 

shares (i.e. discretionary remuneration and 

non-mandatory redemption) would be regarded 

as part of capital and reserves.

ECB

MFI balance sheet and interest rate statistics and EBA guidelines on FINREP and COREP/Large Exposures

March 2012

The FINREP guidelines do not explicitly treat 

the classifi cation of “preference shares”. 
However, IAS 32 does. 59 In order to differentiate 

debt from equities, the IAS framework asserts 

(paragraph 16(a)): “a critical feature in 
differentiating a fi nancial liability from an 
equity instrument is the existence of a contractual 
obligation of one party to the fi nancial 
instrument (the issuer) either to deliver cash or 
another fi nancial asset to the other party (the 
holder) or to exchange fi nancial assets or 
fi nancial liabilities with the holder under 
conditions that are potentially unfavourable to 
the issuer.” 60

Referring to preference shares, AG 25 states: 

“In determining whether a preference share is 
a fi nancial liability or an equity instrument, an 
issuer assesses the particular rights attaching 
to the share to determine whether it exhibits 
the fundamental characteristic of a fi nancial 
liability.”

The key distinction is between preference 

shares that are mandatorily redeemable and 

preference shares that are non-redeemable. 

The former are classifi ed as a fi nancial liability 

(paragraph 16A): “a preference share that 
provides for mandatory redemption by the 
issuer for a fi xed or determinable amount at a 
fi xed or determinable future date, or gives the 
holder the right to require the issuer to redeem 
the instrument at or after a particular date for 
a fi xed or determinable amount, is a fi nancial 
liability.” 61

Depending on their other features, preference 

shares that are non-redeemable may be 

classifi ed either as a fi nancial liability or as 

equity (AG 26): “When preference shares are 
non-redeemable, the appropriate classifi cation 
is determined by the other rights that attach to 
them. Classifi cation is based on an assessment 
of the substance of the contractual arrangements 
and the defi nitions of a fi nancial liability and an 
equity instrument. When distributions to holders 
of the preference shares, whether cumulative 
or non-cumulative, are at the discretion of 
the issuer, the shares are equity instruments.” 

It is unclear, however, whether “distributions to 

holders” refers only to dividends or also to other 

benefi ts, and it is not clear how non-redeemable 

preference shares should be classifi ed when 

dividend distribution is not discretionary. 

The IAS 32 guidance regarding the classifi cation 

of preferred shares, as applied in FINREP, may 

be summarised as follows: 

However, when the IFRS refers to “distribution”, 

this does not include only the distribution of 

dividends but also cases when the entity is being 

wound up and any assets remaining after the 

satisfaction of liabilities become distributable to 

shareholders. 

Conclusion: in order to reconcile the defi nitions 
and treatment of preferred shares (issued), 

the BSI Manual and the FINREP Guidelines 

For cases where IAS/IFRS and FINREP are not implemented 59 

at the national level or are partially implemented (e.g. solo 

reporting), the BAD is applied. In these cases, there may be 

misalignments of IFRS with national specifi c conditions, 

e.g. regarding national tax’s Regulations or other national 

company law, which may include different treatment for 

prudential purposes or specifi c accounting treatment during 

national transposition of the BAD.

There are specifi c cases in the treatment (classifi cation as liability 60 

or equity) of the following case when the mandatory redeemable 

preference shares can be convertible into common shares with 

a convertibility feature attached to them. In such cases some 

concerns can be raised about the classifi cation of the redeemable 

preference shares as liability (non-equity) as long as the issuer 

of the preference shares may never redeem them (so there is 

some kind of issuer’s discretion, and in such a case the proposed 

classifi cation is as “equity”).

According to AG25, a preferred share can be issued with various 61 

rights which an issuer should asses so as to classify the preferred 

share as fi nancial liability or equity. Under such a reference 

system, “non-redeemable preferred shares” are not classifi ed as a 

liability due to the fact that the future obligation to pay dividends 

is not certain (although it can be highly probable). Also, we 

should clarify cases in which there is an option for the issuer to 

redeem the shares for cash and it is highly likely that the option 

will be exercised, so it should be added that preference shares are 

classifi ed as liabilities when the obligation arises, meaning the 

holder has an option to redeem the preference shares independent 

of the fact that it is not certain whether it will be redeemed for 

cash or a fi nancial asset. 

1)  Preference shares which are mandatorily redeemable 
→ fi nancial liability (debt)

2) Non-redeemable preference shares:

distribution of dividends discretionary → equity –

distribution of dividends not discretionary → no clear-cut  –

classifi cation

should provide an explicit explanation of the 

classifi cation of these instruments. A possible 

reconciliation could be to amend the BSI 

Regulation or the BSI Manual to refer explicitly 

to the IAS 32 approach summarised in the table 

above. In parallel, FINREP should clarify the 

treatment of non-redeemable shares, whose 

distribution of dividends is not discretionary. 

Since this reconciliation may create breaks 

in the BSI series, this would require a prior 

consultation of users of such data.

d) Shares and other equity (assets side)

The purpose of this sub-section is to explore the 

links between the defi nition of “Shares and other 

equity” included in the BSI Regulation and the 

related defi nitions in the IAS/IFRS, FINREP, 

and the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). 

In the BSI Regulation, “shares and other equity” 
are instruments representing property rights, 

which are rights to a share in the profi ts of 

the issuer and in its own funds in the event of 

liquidation. The BSI Regulation distinguishes 

between “shares and other equity” and “MMF 

shares/units” on the basis of the issuer of the 

instruments and their nature – MMF shares/

units, which are included in M3 if in the hands of 

the money-holding sectors, are in effect money 

market instruments held at one remove. Holdings 

of instruments that do not represent property 

rights and are not MMF shares/units should be 

classifi ed either as BSI “Securities other than 

shares” or as BSI “Loans” (as “holdings of non-

negotiable securities”), depending on whether 

or not they are negotiable. It should also be kept 

in mind that, according to the BSI Regulation, 

short positions in “shares and other equity” 

(and in securities other than shares) should 

be subtracted from the total amount in this 

instrument category to avoid double counting. 

In the CRD (Article 86), the following defi nition 
of “equity exposures” applies: “(a) non-debt 
exposure conveying a subordinated, residual 
claim on the asset or income of the issuer; and 
(b) debt exposures the economic substance of 
which is similar to the exposures specifi ed in 

point (a)”. This defi nition applies to banks using 
the IRB approach. For the standard approach, 

the term “Equity exposures” is used but not 

defi ned.

In IAS/IFRS, an “equity instrument” is defi ned as 
“any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of an entity after deducting all of 
its liabilities” (IAS 32.11). IFRS 9 Appendix A 
says that the defi nition of “equity instruments” 

is the one included in IAS 32.11. In the latest 

amendments made in IFRS 3 (Improvements 
to IFRS issued in May 2010), the distinction 
is introduced between “equity instruments” 

that are present “ownership” instruments 

and equity instruments that are not. Present 

“ownership” instruments “entitle their holder to 
a proportionate share of the entity’s net asset in 
the event of liquidation” (IFRS 3.19). This item 
includes instruments such as ordinary shares, 

cooperative shares and undated non-cumulative 

preferred shares. The equity instruments 

that are not present “ownership” instruments 

include instruments such as preferred shares 

that guarantee the redemption of the nominal 

amount in the event of liquidation (see IFRS 

3.IE44A-IE44E). In IAS/IFRS, there are 

holdings of “property rights” that represent 

liabilities (as opposed to equity) for the issuer. 

For example, certain cooperative shares 

included in the FINREP item “Share capital 

repayable on demand” are fi nancial liabilities 

for the issuer but represent property rights for 

the holder. IFRIC 2.9 provides that, when a 

cooperative has the right to refuse redemption 

of its shares to prevent its capital falling below a 

certain level, the amount of shares in excess this 

predefi ned level must be classifi ed as liabilities, 

while its minimum level of shares are classifi ed 

as equity.

In FINREP, holdings of “equity instruments” 
are: i) separately presented as a breakdown 

item of each IAS 39 portfolio, ii) presented in 

“investments in entities accounted for using the 

equity method” and iii) included, with other 

assets, in “Non-current assets and disposal 

groups classifi ed as held for sale”.

ECB

MFI balance sheet and interest rate statistics and EBA guidelines on FINREP and COREP/Large Exposures

March 2012

Following the IAS 32 defi nition, the FINREP 

category “Equity instruments” held i) includes 

instruments that are not “ownership” instruments 

but are equity for the issuer, and ii) excludes 

those “property right” instruments that are 

liabilities for the issuer.

When reconciling FINREP and BSI data, it 

should be borne in mind that in FINREP, as the 

focus is on individual banking groups rather than 

on contributions to meaningful aggregates, short 

positions in equity instruments are presented, 

following IAS/IFRS, on the liability side (i.e. 

they are not subtracted from the total amount of 

equity instruments as in BSI “Shares and other 

equity”). 

Conclusion: The IFRS defi nition of “equity 
instruments” excludes those “property right” 

instruments that are liabilities for the issuer 

(e.g. certain cooperative shares). The CRD 

defi nition of “equity exposures” includes debt 

exposures the economic substance of which is 

similar to that of residual claims on the assets 

or income of the issuer. It can be assumed that 

the BSI defi nition of “shares and other equity” 

comprises only instruments that are classifi ed 

as equity for the issuer. In particular, the CRD 

defi nition of “equity exposures” and the BSI 

defi nition of “shares and other equity” may be 

equivalent. If “equity instruments” that are not 

“ownership” instruments are not signifi cant, the 

FINREP defi nition of “Equity instruments” may 

be equivalent to BSI “Shares and other equity”.

2.4 FLOWS (TRANSACTIONS) DATA

As already mentioned, the ECB requirements 

for MFI balance sheet statistics refer not only to 

a balance sheet in terms of stocks, but require 

certain additional information to enable fl ows 

(transactions) to be calculated and used for 

computing growth rates.

The ECB opted for calculating transactions by 

taking the difference between end-period stocks 

and then identifying and removing those effects 

that do not arise from transactions, the “other 

changes” or “adjustments”. 62 To compile 

transactions in accordance with this approach, 

the ECB requires extensive “adjustment” 

information.

“Other changes” are grouped into three 

main categories: “reclassifi cations and other 

adjustments”, “revaluation adjustments” 

and “exchange rate changes”. The fi rst 

category comprises all changes in the balance 

sheet (stocks) which result from statistical 

reclassifi cations: 1) inclusion or exclusion of 

MFIs if the business was transferred into/out of 

the MFI sector; 2) reclassifi cation of assets or 

liabilities (by maturity, sector, residence of the 

counterparty or instrument), some of which may 

be necessitated by reporting errors that have been 

corrected only over a limited time range; and, 

3) effects of changes in structure (mergers, 

acquisitions). The “revaluation adjustments” 

category is made up of two parts: 1) the impact 

of write-offs or write-downs of loans, and 2) the 

impact of fl uctuations in the market price of the 

outstanding stock of marketable securities held 

or issued. The “exchange rate changes” category 

comprises any change in the stock position due 

to the impact of exchange rate movements on 

assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 

currency.

National central banks compile and send 

to the ECB data on “reclassifi cations and 

other adjustments” on the basis of Guideline 

ECB/2007/9 using various (non-harmonised) 

data sources, such as supervisory information, 

ad hoc enquiries and information on joiners 

and leavers of the MFI reporting population. 

The ECB calculates a standard “exchange 

rate adjustment” using currency proportions 

derived from a quarterly breakdown of assets 

and liabilities into major currencies (Table 4 

in the BSI reporting scheme). “Revaluation 

adjustments” are compiled by national central 

banks from data reported by MFIs in Table 1A 

of the BSI Regulation. This table covers 

Transactions are defi ned as the net acquisition of fi nancial assets 62 

or the net incurrence of liabilities.

SHEET-FINREP
(as a minimum) both the write-offs/write-

downs of loans and “price revaluations” in 

respect of holdings of securities. Central banks 

may, however, collect data in addition to the 

minimum requirement.

The compilation of transactions data following 

this approach (adjusted differences of stocks) 

is infl uenced by some of the methodological 

aspects discussed under Section 2.3. In terms of 

reporting population, mergers, acquisitions and 

divisions of two or more MFIs, and mergers, 

acquisitions and divisions when one of the 

institutions is not an MFI usually give rise to 

“reclassifi cations” and “revaluations”, which 

should be properly accounted for and reported.

Transactions should be measured at the value 

at which assets are acquired or disposed of and 

liabilities are created, liquidated or exchanged. 

While providing a good approximation, in 

practice BSI statistics do not fully conform 

to the notion of transactions in the ESA 95. 

Accrued interest is another concept infl uencing 

the compilation of transactions. According 

to international statistical standards, accrued 

interest over the period should be treated as a 

transaction in the underlying instrument, as 

if the interest had been paid out and promptly 

reinvested in the instrument. However, as 

explained above, in BSI statistics, transactions 

in loans and deposits exclude interest that is 

receivable (on loans) or payable (on deposits) but 

has not yet been received or paid, since accrued 

interest on loans/deposits is to be recorded under 

“remaining assets” or “remaining liabilities” 

as appropriate. This consideration also applies 

to debt securities for which accrued interest 

is not intrinsic to the market price (see also 

Section 2.3.2b).

The BSI Regulation also requires loans to be 

recorded gross of all related provisions 

(impairment losses or amounts recorded in 

allowance accounts), with the exception of 

countries where loans net of provisions are 

reported by all resident reporting agents and/or 

are necessary to maintain continuity in the 

statistical valuation of loans with the data 

reported for periods prior to January 2005. The 

adjustment in respect of “write-offs/write-

downs” is reported in order to remove from the 

fl ows statistics the impact of changes in the 

value of loans recorded on the balance sheet that 

are caused by the application of write-offs/write-

downs of loans.63 This adjustment should also 

refl ect the changes in the level of loan-loss 

provisions if a national central bank decides that 

the outstanding stocks should be recorded net of 

provisions. If the loans are written off as a result 

of the option to record loans net of specifi c 

provisions, some discrepancies in terms of 

timing of derecognition may exist.

Transactions data, as defi ned in the international 

statistical standards and in BSI statistics, are 

not collected in FINREP. However, FINREP 

includes fl ows data in the context of the 

consolidated income statement (Table 2) and in 

some of the tables detailing the balance sheet 

information or the income statement. 

In the case of the income statement, these data 

relate to income and expense fl ows generated on 

fi nancial and non-fi nancial assets and liabilities 

during the accounting year. Depending on 

the accounting entry, these data are presented 

on a gross basis (e.g. interest income and 

expenses) or on a net basis (e.g. net gains on 

fi nancial assets and liabilities held for trading). 

Some of the fl ows collected in the income 

statement have a direct link to selected 

“adjustment” items requested for BSI statistics. 

Generally, the BSI concept of “price 

revaluations”, which are collected in Table 1A, 

is recorded in the following FINREP income 

statement items and related breakdowns in 

Template 20 64: “Gains (losses) on fi nancial 

assets and liabilities held for trading, net”, 

“Gains (losses) on fi nancial assets and liabilities 

designated at fair value through profi t or loss, 

net”, “Gains (losses) from hedge accounting, 

net” and “Gains (losses) on derecognition of 

As this would make it appear that credit had been withdrawn.63 

These income statement items may, however, also incorporate 64 

interest and dividend income, depending on the country and 

reporting institution.

assets other than held for sale, net”, and the 

FINREP statement of comprehensive income 

item (Table 21) “Available-for-sale fi nancial 

assets”.65 The FINREP item “Exchange 

differences, net” should broadly correspond to 

the “exchange rate adjustment”, as calculated by 

the ECB using BSI stock data. Impairment 

losses on loans and advances, which correspond 

to the sum of the impairment losses on 

“Available-for-sale fi nancial assets – loans and 

advances”, “Loans and receivables” (excluding 

debt securities which can be traded in secondary 

markets – even only sporadically) and 

“Held-to-maturity investments – loans and 

advances” should in the long run be consistent 

with the amount of “write-offs/write-downs” 

reported in Table 1A of the BSI reporting 

framework.

The FINREP framework also foresees the 

transmission of fl ows data in some of the tables 

detailing the balance sheet information. This 

applies to Table 12 on provisions and Table 9.B 

on movements in allowances. The fi rst table 

requests information on “opening balance”, 

“additions” and “disposals”, and “closing 

balance”, while the second records changes in 

the allowances for credit losses and impairment 

of equity instruments.

Conclusion: As outlined above, although 
FINREP does not require explicit revaluation 

adjustments, there are substantial similarities 

between the two reporting schemes with regard 

to requirements for fl ows (transactions). 

The latter item includes “Valuation gains (losses) taken to 65 

equity” net of amounts “Transferred to profi t or loss”. It may 

also include a component for exchange rate adjustment.

COREP/LARGE

3  STATISTICAL BALANCE SHEET-COREP/LARGE 

EXPOSURES

This chapter follows a similar approach to 

the previous one on BSI-FINREP, this time 

identifying links between the BSI and COREP/

Large Exposures (LE) reporting requirements. 

However, since most methodological aspects 

(e.g. on the reporting population, accounting 

rules, counterpart sector breakdown, etc.) are 

the same, these aspects have not been repeated 

in this chapter (see Annex 2 for an overview). 

However, it should be noted that some of these 

methodological aspects are less stringent, for 

instance the consolidation approach, as COREP 

is requested not only at the consolidated level 

(like FINREP) but also at the solo level (like 

BSI, although with the inclusion of foreign 

branches). Moreover, following a recent 

amendment of the CRD, the implementation of 

COREP/LE is mandatory in all EU countries, 

unlike FINREP. 1

This bridging exercise has focused on current 

COREP (Rev. 3) and LE templates, bearing in 

mind that the templates will be amended again 

by mid-2012 to take account of the development 

of the CRD IV amendments. This chapter 

compares the BSI instrument breakdown with 

the COREP/LE templates. COREP consists 

of four sets of templates aimed at providing a 

reporting format for the Basel II Pillar 1 capital 

requirements, based on the CRD. They were 

fi rst applied in 2007 or early 2008. 

In order to improve the convergence of the 

supervisory reporting frameworks in the 

fi nancial sector and to promote harmonisation 

of supervisory reporting and convergence 

in supervisory practices, COREP covers 

consolidated, sub-consolidated and solo 

reporting of the capital requirements and own 

funds based on the CRD Directive. 

As described in sections 3.1 to 3.4, the following 

COREP (sub-)templates can be bridged with the 

BSI requirements (see details in Annex 5): credit 

risk including securitisation (7 sub-templates),2 

market risk (8 sub-templates),3 and own funds 

(1 template). The operational risk (OPR) 

template could not be bridged; nevertheless, 

a separate analysis has been undertaken 

(see Annex 6).

The LE template can also be linked with BSI 

requirements, as described in section 3.5.

3.1 CREDIT RISK (INCLUDING SECURITISATION)

The BSI items on the assets side fi nd an 

equivalent in the COREP template on credit risk 

if the assets belong to the “banking book”, and 

to the COREP template on market risk if the 

assets (securities) belong to the “trading book” 

(see section 3.2). Assets that are deducted from 

own funds (see section 3.3) are not subject to 

additional capital requirements. 

In the COREP tables, the reporting items are 

classifi ed in different “exposure classes”, which 

have some links to the BSI counterpart sector 

breakdowns. COREP items are recorded under 

several valuation metrics; the link with the BSI 

metrics refers to the original exposure pre 

conversion factors (i.e. risk mitigations),4 as part 

of one or more exposure classes. The latter vary 

depending on whether the bank follows the 

“standardised approach” or an “IRB approach”. 

The detailed bridging can be found in Annex 5. 

The bridging is mainly made at an analytical 

level. For instance, the BSI item “loans” is split 

in accordance with statistical defi nitions into 

sub-components (loans to households, 

convenience and extended credit card credit, 

revolving loans and overdrafts, syndicated 

loans, etc.), which are then bridged with the 

COREP equivalent. 

However, some FINREP templates may soon become EBA 1 

binding technical standards.

The sub-template CR TB SETT has no links with the BSI.2 

The sub-templates MKR IM and MKR IM Details have no links 3 

with the BSI.

For the classifi cation of exposures into the different exposure 4 

classes, COREP has adopted a sequential approach fully 

consistent with the CRD. The original exposure, pre conversion 

factors, is fi rst allocated to the corresponding exposure class. In 

a second phase, the exposures can be redistributed due to the 

application of credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques with 

substitution effects on the exposure (e.g. guarantees, credit 

derivatives, fi nancial collateral simple method) via Infl ows and 

Outfl ows.

For traditional securitisation,5 the link between 

BSI items and securitised exposures reported 

in the COREP Rev. 2 securitisation templates 

(i.e. exposures arising from securitisation 

schemes) applies only for those transactions 

which meet the criterion of signifi cant credit 

risk transfer according to CRD.6 However, 

this constraint has been relaxed in the COREP 

Rev. 3 amendments (see below). 

In particular, COREP Rev. 2 requires data on 

both traditional and synthetic securitisations, but 

not on other loan transfers. Specifi cally, the SEC 

SA and SEC IRB templates require information 

on total exposures towards securitisation 

schemes, but only for the banking book and 

those transactions which meet the criterion of 

signifi cant credit risk transfer according to CRD. 

It is worth noting that with reference to both 

the criterion of signifi cant credit risk transfer 

and the treatment of securitisation positions in 

the trading book, the CRD III amendments will 

bring substantial changes compared with the 

current situation (see below). 

Furthermore, the template SEC Details 

provides a list of individual securitisation 

transactions (ISIN-by-ISIN) in which the bank 

is involved as either originator or sponsor. 

For these data, the potential links between the 

securitised exposures (i.e. the exposures that 

have been originated) and the BSI items will 

be strengthened, since in the context of the 

streamlining activity for COREP the template 

SEC Details will include also the securitisations 

which do not meet the criterion of signifi cant 

credit risk transfer.

As recommended earlier by the JEGR, the BSI 

Manual explains the relationship between the 

concepts of loan securitisation in the statistical 

and supervisory frameworks in the expectation 

that they will be applied by reporting agents in a 

consistent manner.7 The MFI statistical data 

requirements seek to identify securitisation 

transactions undertaken by credit institutions 

involving the sale of loans to fi nancial vehicle 

corporations (FVCs).8 In other words, credit 

institutions are required to report for statistical 

purposes only amounts relating to traditional 

securitisations. This is because the main interest 

for monetary analysis is to correct for loans 

removed from MFIs’ balance sheets.9 

Conversely, in the supervisory framework, 

credit institutions are required, in accordance 

with the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), 

to disclose both traditional and synthetic 

securitisations involving loans originated by 

them, as the focus is on the credit risk transfer, 

and they must disclose synthetic securitisations 

even if undertaken without a securitisation 

vehicle. Although supervisory requirements 

cover all securitisation transactions, while the 

MFI data only covers those with SSPEs or 

FVCs, the difference between the two may be 

captured under the “other loan transfers”, which 

are also reported under the MFI data. If such is 

the case, the coverage would be analogous. 

In a traditional securitisation, assets are sold (divested) off the 5 

balance sheet.

The original exposure will correspond to the Exposure Value for 6 

Counterparty Credit Risk calculated according to the methods 

laid down in Annex III parts 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of Directive 

2006/48/EC.In the case of master netting agreements covering 

repurchase transactions and/or securities or commodities lending 

or borrowing transactions, and/or other capital market driven 

transactions subject to Annex VIII of Directive 2006/48/EC, the 

effect of Funded Credit Protection in the form of master netting 

agreements as under Annex VIII part 3 point 22 of Directive 

2006/48/EC should be included.

The aim is to reconcile the concepts of securitisation, not the actual 7 

fi gures reported under the two frameworks. The fi gures may also 

differ due to the scope of consolidation and valuation rules.

In defi ning securitisation transactions, the BSI Regulation refers 8 

to Article 4 of the Directive 2006/48/EC (the basis for COREP) 

as well as to the FVC Regulation: “‘securitisation’ means a 

transaction which is either: (a) a traditional securitisation as 

defi ned in Article 4 of Directive 2006/48/EC; and/or (b) a 

securitisation as defi ned in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) 

No 24/2009 (ECB/2008/30), which involves the disposal of 

the loans being securitised to an FVC”. FVCs are not the same 

as securitisation special purpose entities (SSPEs). SSPE is the 

term used in the context of the Capital Requirements Directive 

(2006/48/EC), which is the EU transposition of the Basel II 

Accord, while FVCs are defi ned in the ECB Regulation 

addressed to them (ECB/2008/30). Essentially, EU credit 

institutions will apply the FVC defi nition only for entities 

resident in the European Union/euro area, while they apply the 

SSPE defi nition to any securitisation entities, regardless of their 

residence. Moreover, while FVCs may perform securitisation 

as a secondary activity (e.g. as in Portugal), SSPEs are required 

to limit their activity to securitisation. Some entities in Portugal 

may meet the FVC defi nition but not the SSPE defi nition.

Under the Regulation on MFI balance sheet statistics, MFIs 9 

also report deposit liabilities to FVCs and holdings of securities 

issued by FVCs, so that all aspects of securitisation operations 

are covered.

BALANCE SHEET-

EXPOSURES

A further difference between the two approaches 

is that, under the supervisory securitisation 

approach, certain conditions should be met in 

order for securitisation exposures to be eligible 

for exemption from capital requirements. In 

particular, a “signifi cant” transfer of risk must 

take place. Moreover, in the CRD, the tranching 

of the exposures is an essential eligibility 

criterion. Such eligibility conditions are not 

considered in the statistical reporting, with the 

implication that MFI balance sheet statistics 

may comprise securitisation transactions that 

are not tranched and/or whose risk is not 

signifi cantly transferred, and thus not covered 

under the supervisory requirements. Table 7 

summarises the links between the concepts of 

loan securitisation applied in the MFI statistical 

framework and in the CRD, which the JEGR has 

verifi ed for a representative sample of banks.

Setting out the requirements like this may help 

credit institutions to report consistently in the 

two frameworks, which may reduce compliance 

costs and help central banks and supervisors to 

investigate discrepancies and rectify mistakes.10 

Further scope for reconciliation arises from 

the latest (Rev. 3) COREP templates, which 

implement the changes arising from the CRD 

III amendments to the capital requirements 

framework. Most of these amendments affect 

the securitisation templates. In particular, two 

amendments are relevant for the bridging:

1) a new template on market risk relating 

to securitisations (MKR SEC) has been 

added in the COREP set. The assessment 

mentioned above of the relationship 

between securitised assets in COREP and 

BSI statistics thus now applies not only to 

the banking book (credit risk), but also to 

the trading book (market risk); 

2) the scope of application of the SEC details 

has also been extended to the securitisations 

which do not meet the criterion of 

signifi cant credit risk transfer. Indeed, SEC 

details now cover so-called self-

securitisations, which do not involve a 

credit risk transfer.11 This implies that the 

assessment presented above of the 

relationship between securitised assets in 

COREP and in BSI statistics now applies 

to all securitisation schemes, including 

securitisation schemes that do not meet the 

The statistical concept of securitisation is also refl ected in the 10 

FVC Regulation. The following defi nition of FVC is currently 

applied for statistical purposes. “FVC” means an undertaking: 

(a) which is organised to carry out one or more securitisation 

transactions; and (b) which issues, or may issue, securities and/

or which holds, or may hold, assets underlying the issue of 

securities that are offered for sale to the public or sold on the 

basis of private placements; and (c) which is constituted pursuant 

to national or Community law under: (i) contract law (as a 

common fund managed by management companies); (ii) trust 

law; (iii) company law (as a public limited company); or (iv) any 

other similar mechanism; The following are not included in the 

defi nition of FVC: – MFIs within the meaning of Annex I to 

Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 of the European Central Bank of

22 November 2001 concerning the consolidated balance sheet of 

the monetary fi nancial institutions sector (ECB/2001/13); and – IFs 

within the meaning of Article 1 to Regulation (EC) No 958/2007 

of the European Central Bank of 27 July 2007 concerning statistics 

on the assets and liabilities of investment funds (ECB/2007/8).

Self-securitisation by banks has been developing since 2008 11 

in order to create asset-backed securities to be used as eligible

criterion of signifi cant credit risk transfer 

set out in the CRD.

These two amendments to the SEC templates 

allow the relationship with BSI statistics to be 

better specifi ed. Indeed, COREP requires a 

distinction between three different types of bank 

involvement in securitisations: as investor, 

originator (of the securitised loans), or sponsor 

(arranging the deal, fi nding investors, and if 

necessary supporting the securitisation in case of 

diffi culties). A relationship with BSI statistics is 

generally possible only for the fi rst two types 

(investor and originator). In fact, securitisations 

in which banks act purely as sponsors, i.e. they 

do not subscribe to any security issued by the 

FVC, have in most cases no refl ection in BSI 

statistics (however, when the sponsor subscribes 

to securities issued by the FVC, the relationship 

with BSI holds). BSI statistics provide information 

on securitisation where the bank acts as a servicer, 

so that the subsequent history of the securitised 

loans can be traced, but this may not coincide 

with the role of sponsor.12 Moreover, as noted 

above, in the context of the streamlining activity 

of COREP,13 it has been decided to extend the 

scope of application of the SEC details to include 

also securitisations which do not meet the 

criterion of signifi cant credit risk transfer, with 

the consequence that the SEC details template 

will cover also the so-called self-securitisations.14 

This implies that the above-mentioned general 

assessment of the relation between securitised 

assets in COREP and in BSI statistics will apply 

to all securitisation schemes, i.e. also to 

securitisation schemes that do not meet this 

criterion set out in the CRD.

Specifi cally, the link between BSI and COREP 

can be identifi ed for the following reporting 

cells:

1) From the investor and sponsor side:

a) BSI Table 1, row 3 (holdings 

of securities other than shares), 

column FVCs (domestic and other 

participating countries, i.e. resident 

located elsewhere in the euro area), 

i.e. the credit institution’s holdings of 

securities issued by euro area resident 

FVCs; 

b) COREP SEC (SA+IRB) + MKR (SEC): 

securitisation type: traditional, rows 

investor and sponsor: on-balance 

sheet items, columns securitisations 

positions – original exposure pre 

conversion factors, i.e. the credit 

institution’s holdings of securities 

issued by securitisation vehicles for 

which the credit institution acts as a 

sponsor or investor only (i.e. not as an 

originator). 

2) From the loan originator side:

2.1) in the case of derecognition of the 

securitised assets:

Same link as for point 1, row originator for the 

COREP templates, i.e. it includes the credit 

institution’s holdings of securities issued by 

a securitisation vehicle for which the credit 

institution acts as an originator.

2.2) in the case of non-derecognition of the 

securitised assets:

a) BSI Table 5a, row 4 (Outstanding 

amounts of securitised loans not 

COREP includes information on securitisations arranged by a 12 

credit institution as sponsor, because a capital charge is applied to 

cover the reputational risk of a sponsor called upon to intervene 

in case of diffi culties.

The streamlining of COREP is being carried out in accordance 13 

with Art. 74(2) of Directive 2006/48/EC (as amended by 

Art. 9(21) of Directive 2010/78/EU of 24 November 2010), which 

states that “In order to ensure uniform conditions of application 

of this Directive, for the communication of those calculations by 

credit institutions, the competent authorities shall apply, from 

31 December 2012, uniform formats, frequencies and dates of 

reporting”. According to the new provisions as laid down by the 

“Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of 

the Council on prudential requirements for credit institutions and 

investment fi rms” published by the European Commission on 

20 July 2011, the deadline for EBA to develop draft implementing 

technical standards to specify the uniform formats, frequencies 

and dates of reporting and the IT solutions has been moved to 

1 January 2013.

Self-securitisation by banks has been developing since 2008 14 

in order to create asset-backed securities to be used as eligible 

assets for collateralising liquidity provided by central banks.

Under case 2.1, another link can be considered:

a) BSI Table 1, row 3 (securities other

and other participating countries) 

i.e. the credit institution’s holdings of

holdings of securities issued by a 

securitisation vehicle for which the 

credit institution acts as an originator, 

broken down by seniority of the 

securities.

A further link regarding synthetic securitisation 

may be possible with FVC statistics.

Conclusion: there is signifi cant overlap between 
the BSI requirements and COREP template for 

credit risk and market risk. The link refers to the 

original exposure pre-conversion factors. For 

securitised assets, the link applies both for cases 

where the reporting agent is the originator of the 

securitised loans and for those where it holds 

securities issued by the SSPE/FVC.

3.2 MARKET RISK 

With respect to market risk, the bridging 

between the BSI instruments and the COREP 

items is only possible for the standardised 

approach. A similar bridging for the advanced 

approaches (internal models) is not possible, 

because each bank chooses different parameters. 

Market risk is calculated on the trading book 

of credit institutions. The trading book of an 

institution consists of all positions in fi nancial 

instruments (and commodities) held either 

with the intention of trading them or in order 

to hedge other elements of the trading book, 

and which are either free of any restrictive 

covenants on their tradability or are able to be 

hedged. Capital requirements are calculated 

as a percentage of the net position in a set of 

instruments. In calculating the net position, 

positions in derivative instruments may be 

treated as positions in the underlying securities.

The BSI items which fi nd an equivalent in the 

COREP market risk tables other than foreign 

exchange risk are “securities other than shares”, 

“money market fund shares/units” and “shares 

and other equity”.16 The link with the BSI items 

refers to long positions (column 1) associated 

with the specifi c risk component (the risk 

attached to the issuer of the security). 

The detailed bridging can be found in Annex 5.

In addition to the capital requirements regarding 

the position risk, the positions in securities other 

than shares and in money market fund shares/

units – together with the positions in loans – 

are subject to capital requirements for foreign 

exchange risk. In this case, the link with the BSI 

item refers to positions in foreign currencies. 

Conclusion: three BSI items (“securities other 
than shares”, “money market fund shares/units” 

and “shares and other equity”) can be linked 

It should be noted that COREP information includes 15 

securitisations of loans and other instruments, while BSI includes 

only loans.

With regard to fi nancial derivatives, they are treated in the 16 

COREP template on credit risk in the context of the counterpart 

risk.

to their COREP equivalents in the market risk 

template (standard approach only), in particular 

for assets belonging to the trading book. The 

link refers to the long positions associated to the 

specifi c risk component. Another link with BSI 

items concerns capital requirements regarding 

the position risk.

3.3 OWN FUNDS

COREP templates regarding own funds have 

signifi cant links with BSI requirements. 

The BSI items which fi nd an equivalent in the 

own funds template are the following: “capital 

and reserves”, “deposits”, “debt securities 

issued”, “loans” and “securities other than 

shares”. In order to compute the relevant 

supervisory capital aggregates (Tier 1, Tier 2, 

and Tier 3) and own funds deductions, some of 

the COREP items should be added, while others 

should be subtracted. Importantly, because 

the COREP template on own funds is bridged 

to a certain extent with the FINREP Table 1.3 

(statement of fi nancial position), this COREP 

template is indirectly linked to BSI also via 

FINREP. The detailed results of this bridging 

exercise can be found in Annex 5. 

Conclusion: there is a signifi cant degree of 
overlap between the BSI requirements and 

COREP templates for own funds. The link 

refers to several items which need to be added 

or subtracted in order to derive the relevant 

supervisory capital aggregates and own funds 

deductions. A further indirect link is also 

available via FINREP.

3.4 OPERATIONAL RISK

There are no links between the BSI and 

the COREP template on operational risk. 

Under one of the three approaches to 

calculating operational risk requirements (the 

standardised approach), the items included in 

the COREP template (breakdown by business 

line) refer to items in the income statement: 

there is a link between items in the income 

statement reported under FINREP/COREP 

and the MFI statistical requirements, but it is 

weak and applies only for MFI interest rates – 

see Chapter 4. Annex 6 presents the approaches 

to operational risk and explains the results of 

this part of the bridging exercise. 

Conclusion: While there are no links at all 
between the COREP template on operational 

risk and the BSI requirements, there are some 

weak links with MFI interest rate requirements.

3.5 LARGE EXPOSURES

This section focuses on the potential bridging in 

respect of those features which relate specifi cally 

to the large exposures (LE) templates focusing 

on their coverage and instrument categories. 

The LE templates and related guidelines have 

been developed by the EBA, to satisfy the LE 

regime required by the CRD. The LE templates/

guidelines will be included in the COREP 

framework so as to ensure a unifi ed European 

reporting system. Thereafter, large exposures 

reporting will be based on the same standards

EXPOSURES

(i.e. frequency, remittance dates, formats and 

platform) as the other COREP data. The LE 

regime is applied from 31 December 2010. 

Until end-2012, there will be a two-year period 

during which common LE reporting will not be 

available under the binding COREP. Throughout 

this period, the EBA recommends that national 

supervisors incorporate the large exposures 

reporting set out in these guidelines into their 

national reporting system.

Information on LE must be reported at least 

twice a year. As the LE tables will be integrated 

into the COREP framework, the remittance 

dates and the frequency of reporting agreed will 

need to be consistent with COREP (COREP 

sets a general upper limit of quarterly reporting 

as the maximum from 2012). The scope of 

reporting is rather broad. Indeed, information 

about all large exposures, i.e. exposures that 

equal or exceed 10% of own funds, must 

be reported to the competent authorities, 

“including large exposures exempted from the 

application of Article 111(1)” (e.g. intra-group 

exposures, holdings of sovereign debt, etc.). 

The two templates used for the LE reporting are 

reproduced below.

In order to bridge the LE reporting requirements 

with other reporting requirements, a fi rst 

important consideration is that MFI balance 

sheet statistics include all on-balance sheet 

exposures but no off-balance sheet exposures. 

The LE templates cover both. 

The LE templates can be partially linked to 

the COREP CR templates, as LE covers both 

“banking book” and “trading book” exposures, 

while the COREP CR covers only the “banking 

book”; moreover, not all exposures are reported 

in the LE but (naturally) only those that are 

“large” in accordance with the limits set out in 

the CRD. These differences (and similarities) in 

coverage are summarised in Tables 8 and 9.

The LE template provides an instrument 

breakdown, with the total exposure before risk 

provisioning broken down into four categories: 

“assets”, “derivatives”, “off-balance sheet”, and 

“indirect exposures”. This breakdown is fairly 

similar to that of the COREP CR templates.17 

In addition, as the LE data are used for the purposes of calculating 17 

the capital ratios in the CR template, the link between LE and 

COREP CR works, as it refers to the same capital requirements.

MFI balance sheet and interest rate statistics and EBA guidelines on FINREP and COREP/Large Exposures

March 2012

Table 9 summarises the relationship between 

the two templates. The defi nitions of items 

“assets”, “off-balance sheet items” and 

“derivatives” are equivalent.

As mentioned above, the MFI balance sheet 

includes only on-balance sheet exposures. 

Regarding the three categories other than 

“off-balance sheet”, the links with BSI can be 

described as follows.

“Assets” (column LE 1.5) – This variable 
comprises assets referred to in Article 74 

of Directive 2006/48/EC and Article 29 

of Directive 2006/49/EC which are not included 

in any other category. The balance sheet value 

should be reported before value adjustments 

and provisions. Annex 4.3 of this manual 

provides a list of items to be included on the 

assets side. However, the absence of a further 

breakdown of assets by instrument means that 

a closer correspondence with individual BSI 

items is not possible, implying that the EBA 

template cannot be linked in any direct way to 

security-by-security or loan-by-loan data 

collections.

“Derivatives” (column LE 1.6) – This variable 
comprises derivative instruments subject to 

Annex III of the CRD. The exposure corresponds 

to the counterparty credit risk calculated 

according to the methods laid down in Annex III 

of Directive 2006/48/EC before value adjustments 

and provisions. This manual describes the items 

to be included in the assets side. 

“Indirect exposures” (column LE 1.8) – 
According to Article 117 of Directive 2006/48/

EC, a credit institution may use the substitution 

approach to identify the ultimate risk of large 

exposures where an exposure to a client is 

guaranteed by a third party, or secured by 

collateral issued by a third party. Such indirect 

exposures are included in the framework of 

regular reporting, as the overall exposure with 

regard to a client (or group of connected clients) 

has to be counted towards the large exposures 

limit. This approach is consistent with the 

approach taken in the BIS’s International 

Banking Statistics for the determination of 

ultimate risks on a consolidated basis. There is 

no equivalent concept in BSI statistics.

Conclusion: The link between BSI and 
LE-COREP at the instrument level applies only 

to “assets” and “derivatives”. A further indirect 
link with BSI statistics applies, since large 

exposures are calculated as a percentage of own

funds, and the latter is linked to several BSI 

items (“capital and reserves”, “deposits”, “debt 

securities issued”, “loans” and “securities other 

than shares”), as explained earlier.18 

As mentioned above, one of the reasons the 

LE templates can only partially be linked to 

the COREP CR templates is that the latter 

cover only the banking book. This also 

weakens the link with BSI statistics. This link 

could be reinforced if the COREP market risk 

templates (covering the trading book) were 

to include an instrument breakdown similar 

to that in the COREP CR templates, thus 

ensuring that all exposures are covered. This 

extension does not seem burdensome because 

entities need the breakdown by type of 

exposure of the trading book to prepare their 

balance sheet and to report LE data. The EBA 

are considering this suggestion.

3.6 OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The links between the BSI reporting 

requirements and the COREP templates are 

fairly important. This is all the more true because 

COREP is requested not only at the consolidated 

level (like FINREP), but also at the solo level 

(like BSI, although with the inclusion of 

foreign branches). Moreover, following a recent 

amendment of the CRD, the implementation of 

COREP is mandatory in all EU countries, as the 

BSI is in the euro area, and unlike FINREP.

The links between the COREP reporting 

templates and the BSI requirements are 

particularly important with respect to credit risk 

(banking book), market risk (trading book, but 

only for the standardised approach), and own 

funds. However, no link could be found for 

the template on operational risk. These links 

have been implemented to a large extent in the 

relational database, on the basis of the detailed 

guidance described in Annex 5.

The on-balance sheet item “Assets” in the COREP credit risk 18 

templates is described as “Assets referred to in article 74 of 
Directive 2006/48/EC not included in any other category”.

March 2012

4 MFI INTEREST RATES-COREP/FINREP

This chapter covers the relationship between 

COREP/FINREP and MFI interest rate statistics 

(MIR). As mentioned in the introduction, MIR 

covers information about interest rates paid and 

charged by MFIs on deposits and loans 

denominated in euro in their business with 

households and non-fi nancial corporations in 

the euro area.1 The concepts, defi nitions and 

valuation rules used for MIR are almost identical 

to those in the BSI Regulation.

While the bridging between FINREP and the 

BSI statistics is relatively straightforward, since 

both schemes collect balance sheet information 

based to a large extent on the IAS/IFRS (see 

Chapter 2), that between the MIR scheme 

and COREP/FINREP is largely restricted to 

identifying common features in defi nitions and 

sector/instrument classifi cations, already done 

in the BSI-FINREP bridging. Nevertheless, 

Annex 2 provides a summary of key differences 

between COREP/FINREP and MIR.

The following sections describe the MIR 

framework and the features it shares with 

COREP/FINREP.

4.1 THE MAIN FEATURES AND STRUCTURE 

OF MFI INTEREST RATES

The MIR reporting population is a sub-set of the 

BSI population since it comprises (within the 

MFI sector) only resident credit institutions and 

a few other institutions which take deposits from 

and/or grant loans to households and/or non-

fi nancial corporations resident in the same area. 

It excludes central banks and money market 

funds (MMFs). This means the MIR reporting 

population substantially coincides with that of 

FINREP and COREP, but is smaller than that 

for BSI statistics. Central banks may require 

all institutions within the population to report, 

or select a sample.

MIR statistics are needed to analyse the 

transmission of the Eurosystem’s monetary 

policy initiatives to the euro area economy. 

Since MFIs are by far the largest group of 

fi nancial intermediaries in the euro area, how 

the rates which they pay and charge respond 

to changes in the terms of the Eurosystem’s 

refi nancing operations is of the greatest 

importance. MIR statistics also contribute to 

the analysis of structural developments in the 

banking and fi nancial system and to fi nancial 

stability issues. 

The MIR business coverage includes both 

outstanding amounts and new business but 

excludes bad loans and loans for debt restructuring 

at rates below market conditions. “New 

business” means any new agreement between 

the household or non-fi nancial corporation and 

the reporting agent: new agreements are all 

fi nancial contracts specifying, for the fi rst time, 

the interest rate on a deposit or loan, and all new 

negotiations of existing deposits and loans.

MIR interest rates are the weighted averages of 

annualised agreed rates (AAR), which exclude 

charges; for housing loans and consumer 

loans, the annualised percentage rate of charge 

(APRC), including fees, commissions, etc., is 

also collected. In the case of rates on outstanding 

amounts, the MIR Regulation (ECB/2001/18, as 

amended by ECB/2009/7) allows two different 

calculation methods: a) an end-period snapshot, 

or b) implicit rates (interest paid or charged 

in the period divided by the relevant average 

amount deposited or lent out). 

MFI interest rate statistics provide detailed 

monthly information on numerous categories of 

new deposit and loan business and outstanding 

amounts: 2

The legal requirements for MFI interest rate statistics are 1 

laid down in the Regulation ECB/2001/18, which defi nes the 

statistical standards according to which monetary fi nancial 

institutions must report their interest rate statistics. This 

Regulation is complemented by the Manual on MFI interest rate 

statistics, which further clarifi es and illustrates the statistical 

requirements. Regulation ECB/2001/18 was amended by 

Regulation ECB/2009/7, which provides for a number of 

improvements to the reporting scheme.

d) Additionally, the Regulation requires interest 

rate data on convenience and extended credit 

card credit, loans to sole proprietors, and 

collateralised loans (real estate collateral).

4.2 THE LINKS BETWEEN COREP AND MFI 

INTEREST RATES 

As mentioned in Chapter 3, COREP comprises 

four sets of templates. For each set, the 

subsections below provide an analysis of the 

links with the MIR requirements.

4.2.1 OWN FUNDS TEMPLATES

This set of COREP templates contains 

information about the Pillar 1 solvency ratio, 

both numerator (own funds) and denominator 

(capital requirements); moreover, it provides, 

for affi liated entities or subgroups, the capital 

requirements for each risk category, the own 

funds for solvency purposes and the resulting 

surplus or defi cit of own funds. 

There is no link between this set of templates 

and MIR requirements (as interest rate 

statistics do not deal with capital and reserves). 

More detailed breakdowns for the different risk 

types can be found in the respective templates 

(see below).

4.2.2 CREDIT RISK TEMPLATES

There are two versions of credit risk templates: 

one for exposures subject to the standardised 

approach (SA) and one for exposures under the 

internal rating-based approach (IRB). In general, 

small and medium-sized institutions use the 

SA approach; bigger institutions may have the 

resources to develop their own models and gain 

approval as IRB institutions.

SA institutions have at most to fi ll in Templates 

(1) CR SA, (4) CR SEC SA, (6) CR SEC Details 

and (7) CR CB SETT, while IRB institutions 

could be asked to fi ll in Templates (2) CR IRB, 

(3) CR EQU IRB, (5) CR SEC IRB, (6) CR SEC 

Details and (7) CR TB SETT. 

1) CR SA template: this template is to be fi lled 
in for each exposure class according to 

CRD Article 79 (SA), or alternatively, CRD 

Article 86 (IRB) for institutions applying 

the SA only to part of their exposures. The 

most interesting information regarding 

this COREP template concerns real estate

exposures to the retail sector (in relation to 

the latest update of the MFI Regulations). 

Indeed, MIR and COREP have defi nitions 

of real estate collateral in common; the 

proposal to bridge those defi nitions has 

already been mentioned.

2) CR IRB. This template, applicable to IRB 
institutions, requests aggregated information 

on the input parameters that are used 

for calculating risk-weighted exposures 

(exposure values, LGD (loss given default), 

etc.) and on the amount and type of credit 

risk mitigation techniques used. As for 

the CR SA template, the most interesting 

information from the template (in terms of 

a link with MIR) concerns collateral in the 

form of real estate. 

3) CR EQU IRB. The template concerning 
exposure relating to equity assets has no 

links with the MIR requirements.

4) CR SEC SA. This template covers aggregated 
information on all current exposures arising 

from securitisations, irrespective of who 

holds the positions. National supervisors 

can decide to request the template fi lled 

in for all securitisation types as a total or 

separately for traditional and synthetic 

securitisation. Beyond the considerations 

made in Chapter 2 regarding the statistical 

and supervisory concepts of securitisation, 

there is no link between this template and 

the MIR Regulation which does not cover 

securitised loans unless they have not 

been derecognised, and so remain on the 

balance sheet.

5) CR SEC IRB. This template follows the same 
structure as the previous template but applies 

the IRB methodology to securitisation 

positions. There is no link with the 

MIR Regulation.

6) CR SEC Details. This template covers the 
same securitisation items as reported under 

either CR SEC SA or CR SEC IRB, but 

on a deal-by-deal basis. Securitisations 

of assets originated by the reporting 

institution and operations sponsored by it 

are covered. There is no direct link with the 

MIR Regulation.

7) CR TB SETT. This template requests 
information on unsettled transactions in the 

trading book and banking book 3 and related 

capital requirements for settlement risk. 

There is no link with the MIR Regulation.

4.2.3 MARKET RISK TEMPLATES

The COREP market risk templates are based 

on the trading portfolio. None of the six 

market risk templates contains a link with the 

MIR requirements.

4.2.4 OPERATIONAL RISK TEMPLATES

The COREP operational risk (OPR) templates 

are based on the information required 

under Annex X of Directive 2006/48/EC. 

The information is collected through three 

sub-templates. 

There is no link between the capital 

requirements related to operational risk 

and MIR requirements, although for some 

business lines under one of the templates 

(that concerning the Alternative Standardised 

Approach (ASA)), the total nominal amount 

of loans and advances is needed. For the 

other templates, there are no links with the 

MIR requirements.

4.3 THE LINKS BETWEEN FINREP AND MFI 

INTEREST RATES

The structure of FINREP is described in 

Chapter 2. The focus here is on the links 

with MIR.

4.3.1 ACTUAL REPORTING POPULATION

As mentioned above, the MIR reporting 

population substantially overlaps with that of 

FINREP and COREP; it is narrower than that 

for BSI statistics.

This is part of the information requested in COREP rev 3.3

4 MFI  INTEREST 
RATES-COREP/F INREP

4.3.2 COLLECTED DATA TYPES

The types of data collected within the 

MIR framework cover both interest rates 

and business volumes (new business and 

outstanding amounts). It is important to recall 

that an annualised agreed rate (AAR) or a 

narrowly defi ned effective rate (NDER) are 

collected for all loans, and in addition, an 

annualised percentage rate of charge (APRC) is 

collected for housing loans and consumer loans. 

In the case of rates on outstanding amounts, 

the Regulation allows two calculation methods: 

a snapshot of end-period observations,• 

implicit rates, calculated as the fl ow of • 

interest during the reference month divided 

by the average stock of related deposits or 

loans in the month, based preferably on 

daily, and at least on weekly, amounts. In 

contrast to end-month observations, the 

MFI interest rates on outstanding amounts 

compiled as monthly averages include 

contracts that were outstanding at some 

time during the month, but are no longer 

outstanding at the end of the month. 

The second calculation method implies the 

possible use of profi t and loss data if at least 

weekly balance sheets are available. 

In FINREP, no interest rate information is 

collected. However, implicit rates could be 

calculated using profi t and loss information, 

if the second calculation method, as above, 

is used. Using profi t and loss data for the 

calculation of implicit interest requires the MIR 

classifi cations to be available also in profi t and 

loss data. More specifi cally, fl ows of interest 

payable from deposits and interest receivable 

from loans would have to have been classifi ed 

by MIR sectors, instruments, period of notice 

and original maturity. 

Even then, the instruments might not be properly 

matched with the MIR instruments. For example, 

the calculation of implicit interest rates would 

require classifi cations for profi t and loss items 

in FINREP similar to those in MIR. FINREP 

contains no information on new business in the 

sense used in MIR. Other cost elements included 

in the APRC cannot be identifi ed in FINREP. 

4.3.3 INSTRUMENTS

The instruments in MIR statistics are basically 

the same as in BSI statistics. 

The exception concerns bad loans and loans 

for debt restructuring at rates below market 

conditions, which are excluded in the calculation 

of MIR interest rates. Nevertheless, the weights 

applied in MIR statistics do not exclude bad 

loans, since they are included indistinguishably 

in the BSI statistics (unless they have been 

written off, or the national central bank allows 

loans to be reported net of provisions). The 

MIR Regulation refers to the BSI Regulation 

defi nition of bad loans, namely “loans in respect 
of which repayment is overdue or otherwise 
identifi ed as being impaired, partially or totally, 
in accordance with the defi nition of default in 
Directive 2006/48/EC”. FINREP provides data 
exclusively on past due and impaired loans that 

are not measured at fair value through profi t and 

loss. The CRD defi nition of “default” is slightly 

different from the accounting defi nition of 

“impaired assets” plus “past due but not impaired 

assets (over 90 days)” used for FINREP purpose, 

because a fi nancial asset must be qualifi ed as in 

“default” when it is considered that the debtor 

is unlikely to pay it in full “without recourse by 
the credit institution to actions such as realising 
security”. 

Under IAS 39, an impaired loan is deemed to be 

in default if the period of “recourse actions such 

as realising security” has passed 90 days. The 

classifi cation of an impaired loan in accordance 

with IAS 39 is necessary to record an impairment 

loss. This difference concerns only loans that 

are not more than 90 days past due.

FINREP instrument categories partly overlap 

with those in MIR (see Chapter 2). In the core 

tables, the main instruments deposits and loans 

and advances can be found. For deposits, FINREP 

offers a direct reference to the defi nition in the 

BSI Regulation. A more detailed breakdown by 

product can be found in Table 10.A for deposits 



68
ECB

MFI balance sheet and interest rate statistics and EBA guidelines on FINREP and COREP/Large Exposures

March 2012

(current accounts/overnight deposits, deposits 

with agreed maturity, deposits redeemable 

at notice, repurchase agreements). The BSI 

instrument category “loans” has a link with the 

corresponding FINREP instrument “loans and 

advances”. FINREP offers in Table 6.A a match 

with the BSI defi nition of loans except those 

included in the “other” category (advances that 

cannot be classifi ed as “loans” according to 

the ECB Regulation). Nevertheless, FINREP 

does not provide the detailed classifi cation of 

those loans and deposits represented as “held 

for sale”.

For the differences in valuation method and the 

treatment of accrued interest, see Chapter 2. 

Much as for BSI statistics (see section 2.3.3), 

a possible link between MIR and FINREP arises 

in respect of the treatment of hybrid deposits 

(deposits with an embedded derivative). 4 The 

MIR Regulation explicitly deals with the 

treatment of hybrid deposits with a “guaranteed 

minimum return”. The treatment of certain 

hybrid deposits without a guaranteed minimum 

return is described in the Manual on MFI interest 

rate statistics (October 2003), which questions 

whether hybrid deposits without a guaranteed 

minimum return should be classifi ed as “deposits” 

in BSI statistics. In the absence of further 

guidance, the opportunity arises to establish a 

link between BSI/MIR and the IAS 39 approach 

as followed in FINREP. Thus, in IAS/IFRS, to 

separate the hybrid contract, the entity estimates 

the fair value of the embedded derivative; 

the initial carrying amount of the host contract is 

then the residual amount after subtracting the fair 

value of the derivative from the amount received 

or paid (see IAS 39.AG28).5 To accrue interest in 

the fi nancial instrument, IAS 39 allows the credit 

institution to calculate an implicit rate for the 

host contract (the discount rate that equates the 

amount to be received or paid at maturity with 

the initial carrying amount of the host contract). 

This rate (if equal to or higher than 0%) could be 

used in MIR for new business and outstanding 

amounts when end-period observations are used. 

When outstanding amounts refer to period 

averages, this rate has already been used for the 

accrual of interest payable/receivable and the 

host contract is included in the stock of deposits 

or loans.

In the second case, where the hybrid deposit is 

not segregated and the entity does not calculate 

an implicit rate for the host contract, there is no 

separate accrual of interest for the host contract 

(interest is reported together with other gains or 

losses). In this case, the rate used in MIR new 

business could be 0%. This convention seems 

appropriate, as the segregation of the hybrid 

instrument would have drawbacks (e.g. it could 

be a complex contract and the separation would 

not result in reliable information).

The information on the interest rate for each 

hybrid contract is not separately reported in 

FINREP, but it should be available because 

it is necessary for both IAS/IFRS fi nancial 

statements and FINREP templates.

4.3.4 SECTOR AND RESIDENCY 

OF COUNTERPARTIES

As discussed in Chapter 2, a reconciliation 

of counterparty sectors is possible. However, 

the FINREP counterparty breakdown applies 

to domestic and foreign residents, whereas the 

MIR is confi ned to domestic and other euro 

area residents. In particular, FINREP provides 

in Table 15 a geographical breakdown of assets 

and liabilities by residence of the counterparty, 

with four columns: Domestic, Other EMU 

countries, Other EU countries and Rest of the 

world. Consequently, FINREP provides data 

on domestic and other euro area countries as in 

MIR statistics. 

4.3.5 BREAKDOWN BY INTEREST RATE FIXATION, 

PERIOD OF NOTICE, ORIGINAL MATURITY

MIR requires a breakdown by original maturity, 

period of notice, or initial period of fi xation, 

According to MIR amending Regulation (ECB/2009/7), Annex II, 4 

Part 6, paragraph 83, “(..) a deposit with an agreed maturity to 

which a fi xed interest rate is being applied and an embedded 

derivative with a return that is linked to the performance of a 

defi ned stock exchange index or a bilateral exchange rate (…)”.

The derivative does not generate interest; changes in its value are 5 

recorded as holding gains or losses.

4 MFI  INTEREST 
RATES-COREP/F INREP

according to the type of instrument and whether 

the MFI interest rate refers to outstanding 

amounts or to new business.

In particular, new business in loans should 

be reported by period of interest rate fi xation 

instead of original maturity. The period of 

interest rate fi xation is the period determined at 

the start of a contract during which the interest 

rate cannot change. The initial period of fi xation 

may be shorter than or equal to the original 

maturity of the loan. The new BSI Regulation 

introduces the concept of interest rate reset, 

similar to interest rate fi xation but applied to 

outstanding amounts, not new business (which 

is not reported in BSI statistics). No similar 

concept can be found in FINREP. The same 

applies to the breakdown by period of notice.

Finally, the MIR breakdown by original 

maturity corresponds to the one defi ned in BSI 

statistics. However, as discussed in Chapter 2, 

FINREP does not require data on original or 

residual maturity.

4.3.6 SIZE OF INDIVIDUAL LOANS

For new business in the category “other loans to 

non-fi nancial corporations”, the MIR framework 

introduces a further breakdown by size of loan 

as a proxy for the size of the borrowing company 

(the idea being that larger companies are in a 

stronger negotiating position and can achieve 

better conditions than smaller fi rms). FINREP 

requires no information on size of loan.

4.4 CONCLUSIONS

The links between the MIR reporting 

requirements and the FINREP/COREP 

templates are rather weak. Although the 

reporting population is broadly the same, the 

different objectives of the two frameworks 

limit their common features to the defi nitions 

and sector/instrument classifi cations. The data 

requirements differ substantially. Nevertheless, 

some links between COREP/FINREP and MIR 

are recorded in the relational database.

The links between COREP and MIR in 

particular are limited. The most interesting area 

lies with collateral and guarantees in the credit 

risk templates. As far as the links between 

FINREP and MIR are concerned, the two areas 

with potential synergy concern the treatment of 

hybrid deposits and the link between profi t and 

loss account data and MIR. Regarding hybrid 

deposits, the implicit interest rate calculated for 

the deposit under IAS 39 could be reused for 

MIR statistics. 

Regarding the link between profi t and loss 

account data and MIR, whereas most national 

central banks calculate interest rates on 

outstanding amounts as end-period snapshots, 

the MIR Regulation does allow interest rates to 

be calculated implicitly, where the numerator 

could be extracted from profi t and loss accounts, 

and hence from FINREP data. Using profi t and 

loss data for the calculation of implicit interest 

essentially requires that the MIR classifi cations 

are available also in the FINREP template on 

the income statement, i.e. interest payable from 

deposits and interest receivable from loans 

should be classifi ed by MIR sectors, instruments, 

periods of notice and original maturity.

GLOSSARY

Alternative Standardised Approach (ASA): The Alternative Standardised Approach (ASA) is 
a special variant of the Standardised Approach in which an alternative indicator is used to calculate 

the capital requirement for the retail and commercial banking business lines. 

Annualised Agreed Rate (AAR): The annualised agreed rate (AAR) is an interest rate for a deposit 
or loan calculated on an annual basis and quoted as an annual percentage.

Annualised Percentage Rate of Charge (APRC): The annual percentage rate of charge (APRC) 
consists of the total costs of the loan for the consumer. The total costs comprise an interest rate 

component (which is identical to the narrowly defi ned effective rate) and a component for all 

other costs related to the loan. This includes, for instance, the costs for enquiries, administration, 

document preparation, guarantees, and credit insurance. 

Banking Accounts Directive (BAD): Council Directive of 8 December 1986 on the annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts of banks and other fi nancial institutions (86/635/EEC). It applies to 

most credit institutions (i.e. banks) and other fi nancial institutions, with a few national exceptions. 

BAD describes a standard balance sheet layout, in which assets and liabilities are presented in 

decreasing order of liquidity, and two standard profi t-and-loss account layouts (vertical and 

horizontal). Also it sets out valuation rules for certain fi nancial assets. 

Basel III (International regulatory framework for banks): Basel III is a comprehensive set of 
reform measures, developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to strengthen the 

Regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. These measures aim to improve 

the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from fi nancial and economic stress, whatever 

the source, to improve risk management and governance, and to strengthen banks’ transparency and 

disclosures. The reforms concern bank-level, or microprudential, Regulation, which will help raise 

the resilience of individual banking institutions both to periods of stress, and to macroprudential, 

system-wide risks that can build up across the banking sector, as well as to the procyclical 

amplifi cation of these risks over time. These two approaches to supervision are complementary, 

as greater resilience at the individual bank level reduces the risk of system-wide shocks. 

Capital Requirement Directive (CRD): This refers to both Directive 2006/48/EC and Directive 
2006/49/EC, regarding liquidity standards, defi nition of capital, leverage ratio, counterparty 

credit risk, and counter-cyclical measures, including through-the-cycle provisioning for expected 

credit losses, systemically important fi nancial institutions and single rule book in banking. 

On 20 July 2011, the European Commission adopted a legislative package to strengthen the 

Regulation of the banking sector (CRD IV). The proposal replaces the current Capital Requirements 

Directives (2006/48 and 2006/49) with a Directive and a Regulation, and constitutes another major 

step towards creating a sounder and safer fi nancial system.

Collective Investment Undertakings (CIUs): See Undertakings for Collective Investment in 
Transferable Securities.

Common Reporting (COREP): To achieve a high level of harmonisation and strong convergence 
in regular supervisory reporting requirements, the EBA issued guidelines on prudential reporting 

with the aim of developing a supervisory reporting framework based on common formats. 

The Guidelines on Common Reporting cover consolidated, sub-consolidated and solo reporting.

GLOSSARY

Consolidated Banking Data (CBD): These data contain information on the profi tability, balance 
sheets and solvency of EU banks, and refer to all EU Member States. The banks are divided into three 

size groups: small, medium-sized and large. In addition, the data provide information on foreign-

controlled institutions active in EU countries. The statistics are based on annual and semi-annual data. 

The Consolidated Banking Data are based on the pooling of relevant aggregated information provided 

by the member organisations of the ESCB’s Financial Stability Committee (FSC). 

Counterparty credit risk: The counterparty credit risk is defi ned as the risk that the counterparty 
to a transaction could default before the transaction is fi nally settled. An economic loss occurs if 

the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty have a positive economic value 

at the time of default. Unlike a fi rm’s exposure to credit risk through a loan, where the exposure 

to credit risk is unilateral and only the lending bank faces the risk of loss, the counterparty credit 

risk creates a bilateral risk of loss: the market value of the transaction can be positive or negative to 

either counterparty to the transaction. 

Credit institution: Any institution covered by the defi nition contained in Article 4(1) of Directive 
2006/48/EC (recast). Accordingly, a credit institution is “(i) an undertaking whose business is to 
receive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant credits for its own account; 
or (ii) an electronic money institution within the meaning of Directive 2000/46/EC”. 

Credit Risk (CR): This acronym is used for a number of COREP templates on credit risk, which 
provide detailed information on the distribution of the exposure values according to the different 

risk weights or by exposure types.

Cross-Border and Cross-Sector Consolidation Basis for All Domestically Incorporated 
(CBCSDI): It includes the data of domestically incorporated, domestically controlled entities in the 
sector, and of domestically incorporated subsidiaries of foreign entities classifi ed in the same sector, 

along with the data of these domestically incorporated entities’ branches and subsidiaries, which can 

be either domestic or foreign residents, including the data of such subsidiaries in other sectors.

Derecognition: Derecognition means the removal of a loan or part thereof from the balance sheet. 
IAS 39 (paragraphs 14 to 42) describes in detail the conditions that should be fulfi lled for recognition and 

derecognition of fi nancial assets and liabilities. Due to the complexity of the conditions for derecognition 

of fi nancial assets, IAS 39. AG36 provides an explanatory fl ow chart, and the FINREP framework 

contains a table (Table 12) for collecting detailed information on transfers of fi nancial assets.

Domestic Consolidation (DC) basis: It includes the data of resident entities along with those of 
their branches and subsidiaries in the same sector that are resident in the domestic economy.

Domestically Controlled Cross-Border and Cross-Sector Consolidation Basis (DCCBS): 
It includes the data of domestically incorporated, domestically controlled entities in the sector, 

their branches (domestic and foreign), and all their subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) that are 

classifi ed in the same sector, as well as in other sectors. 

Domestically-Controlled Cross-Border Consolidation Basis (DCCB): It includes the data of 
domestically incorporated, domestically controlled entities in the sector, along with the data of 

their branches (domestic and foreign) and of all their subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) that are 

classifi ed in the same sector.

Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 in the course of 1999, is the European Union’s current version of the 

internationally used System of National Accounts (SNA93). The ESA 95 is planned to be replaced 

by ESA 2010, which is consistent with the SNA 2008, in 2014.

European System of Central Banks (ESCB): The ESCB is the central banking system of the 
European Union. It comprises the ECB and the national central banks of all EU Member States.

European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB): The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) is an 
independent EU body responsible for the macro-prudential oversight of the fi nancial system 

within the European Union. Located in Frankfurt am Main, its secretariat is provided by 

the ECB. The ESRB, which is part of the European System of Financial Supervisors, contributes 

to the prevention or mitigation of systemic risks to fi nancial stability in the Union that arise from 

developments within the fi nancial system. It takes into account macroeconomic developments, 

so as to avoid periods of widespread fi nancial distress. The ESRB also contributes to the smooth 

functioning of the internal market and thereby ensures a sustainable contribution of the fi nancial 

sector to economic growth.

Eurosystem: The central banking system of the euro area, comprising the ECB and the national 
central banks of the EU Member States whose currency is the euro.  

Fair value accounting (FVA): A valuation principle that stipulates the use of either a market price, 
where it exists, or an estimation of a market price as the present value of expected cash fl ows to 

establish the balance sheet value of fi nancial instruments.

Financial Reporting (FINREP): To achieve a high level of harmonisation and strong convergence 
in regular supervisory reporting requirements, guidelines on supervisory reporting have been 

developed with the aim of setting up a supervisory reporting model with common data defi nitions. 

The Guidelines on Financial Reporting cover consolidated and sub-consolidated fi nancial reporting 

for supervisory purposes based on IAS/IFRS as endorsed by the European Union.

Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs): The Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) have been 
developed by the IMF, together with the international community, with the aim of supporting 

macro-prudential analysis and assessing the strengths and vulnerabilities of fi nancial systems.

Financial Stability Committee (FSC): The FSC assists the decision-making bodies of the ECB 
in the fulfi lment of its tasks in the fi eld of prudential supervision of credit institutions and the 

stability of the fi nancial system, as laid down in Article 127.5 of the Treaty on the Functioning of 

the European Union and the ESCB Statute.

Financial Vehicle Corporation (FVC): An undertaking constituted under national or Community 
law and whose principal activity is to carry out securitisation transactions. FVCs are insulated 

from the risk of bankruptcy or any other default of the originator. FVCs may issue securities,

securitisation fund units, other debt instruments and/or fi nancial derivatives. They may legally or 

economically own assets underlying the issue of securities, securitisation fund units, other debt 

instruments and/or fi nancial derivatives that are offered for sale to the public or sold on the basis of 

private placements. 

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): Accounting requirements for business 
enterprises in the United States, established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), 

predecessor organisations and others.

Held-to-Maturity (HTM) instruments: HTM is a category of fi nancial assets as defi ned by 
Paragraph 9 of IAS 39. This standard identifi es and defi nes four categories of fi nancial assets: 

(i) those held at fair value through profi t or loss; (ii) held-to-maturity investments; (iii) loans and 

receivables; and (iv) available-for-sale fi nancial assets. Held-to-maturity must be measured at 

amortised cost using the effective interest method.

IAS consolidation scope (IAS 27): This Standard must be applied in the preparation and presentation 
of consolidated fi nancial statements for a group of entities under the control of a parent. It must also be 

applied in accounting for investments in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates when 

an entity elects, or is required by local Regulations, to present separate fi nancial statements.

Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach: The IRB approach of the Basel Capital Accord provides 
a single framework by which a given set of risk components or “inputs” are translated into minimum 

capital requirements. The framework allows for both a foundation method and more advanced 

methodologies. In the foundation method, banks estimate the probability of default associated with 

each borrower, and the bank supervisors supply the other inputs. In the advanced methodology, 

a bank with a suffi ciently developed internal capital allocation process is permitted to supply other 

necessary inputs as well.

International Accounting Standards (IAS): International Accounting Standards (IAS) were 
developed by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) with the purpose of 

establishing a single set of global accounting standards. See also International Financial Reporting 

Standards (IFRS) below.

International Banking Statistics (IBS): The BIS compiles both locational banking statistics 
and consolidated banking statistics. The locational banking statistics present quarterly data on 

international fi nancial claims and liabilities of bank offi ces resident in the reporting countries. 

In this system, positions are recorded on a gross (unconsolidated) basis, which is consistent with the 

principles of national accounts, balance of payments and external debt statistics. The consolidated 

banking statistics present quarterly data on banks’ international fi nancial claims. The data are 

collected on a worldwide consolidated basis with inter-offi ce positions netted out. 

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS): IFRS is the new title for the International 
Accounts Standards (IAS), the body of standards in effect since end-March 2004 and applicable 

from the beginning of 2005. 

Large and complex banking group (LCBG): A banking group whose size and nature of business 
is such that its failure or inability to operate would probably have adverse implications for fi nancial 

intermediation, the smooth functioning of fi nancial markets or other fi nancial institutions operating 

within the fi nancial system.

MFI balance sheet and interest rate statistics and EBA guidelines on FINREP and COREP/Large Exposures

March 2012

Large Exposures (LE): The EBA has developed common reporting templates and guidelines in 
relation to large exposures reporting, which will be included in the COREP framework so as to ensure 

a unifi ed European reporting system. Thereafter, large exposures reporting will be based on the same 

standards (i.e. frequency, remittance dates, formats and platform) as the other COREP data. 

Market Risk (MR): Market risk is defi ned as the risk of losses in on- and off-balance-sheet 
positions arising from movements in market prices. The risks subject to this requirement are those 

concerning interest rate-related instruments and equities in the trading book, and foreign exchange 

risk and commodities risk throughout the bank.

MFI interest rate statistics (MIR): MIR cover those interest rates that credit institutions and 
a few other institutions apply to euro-denominated deposits from and loans to households and 

non-fi nancial corporations resident in the euro area. These harmonised statistics are used for the 

analysis of monetary developments and the monetary transmission mechanism as well as for the 

monitoring of fi nancial stability.

Monetary fi nancial institution (MFI): A “monetary fi nancial institution” (MFI) means a resident 
undertaking that belongs to any of the following sectors: (i) central banks; (ii) credit institutions as 

defi ned in Article 4(1) of Directive 2006/48/EC; (iii) other MFIs, i.e. (1) other fi nancial institutions 

whose business is (i) to receive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from entities other 

than MFIs; and (ii) for their own account, at least in economic terms, to grant credits and/or make 

investments in securities; or (2) such electronic money institutions that are principally engaged in 

fi nancial intermediation in the form of issuing electronic money; (iv) money market funds (MMFs) 

as defi ned in Article 1a. 

Money Market Fund (MMF): A collective investment undertaking (CIU) which fulfi ls the MFI 
defi nition. The detailed criteria which a fi nancial institution must meet for classifi cation as an MMF 

are set out in Regulation ECB/2011/12, Article 1.2. 

Narrowly Defi ned Effective Rate (NDER): The narrowly defi ned effective rate (NDER) refl ects 
the annual costs of a loan in terms of the size of the loan, possible disagios, maturity and interest 

settlements. This makes it possible to compare the costs of loans with identical periods of interest 

rate fi xation. Unlike the annual percentage rate of charge (see above), no other costs related to the 

loan are taken into account. The NDER is the interest rate which, on an annual basis, equalises the 

present value of all commitments (deposits or loans, payments or repayments, interest payments), 

future or existing, agreed between the bank and the household or non-fi nancial corporation.

Operational risk (OR): Operational risk is defi ned as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or 
failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. This defi nition includes legal 

risk but excludes strategic and reputational risk.

Other fi nancial intermediary (OFI): A fi nancial corporation or quasi-corporation engaged 
mainly in fi nancial intermediation but which is not an MFI, insurance corporation or pension fund. 

The category includes investment funds other than MMFs (some of which may provide venture 

capital), entities engaged primarily in long-term fi nancing, such as corporations engaged in 

fi nancial leasing, fi nancial vehicle corporations created to be holders of securitised assets, fi nancial 

holding corporations, dealers in securities and derivatives (when dealing for their own account), 

and development capital companies.

GLOSSARY

Preference shares: Preference shares are securities that pay a fi xed rate of dividend and have a 
mandatory redemption feature at a future date. Alternatively, they may not have a fi xed maturity, 

and the issuer does not have a contractual obligation to make any payment. 

Securitisation: Securitisation means a transaction or scheme whereby an asset or pool of assets is 
transferred to an entity that is separate from the originator and is created for or serves the purpose 

of the securitisation, and/or the credit risk of an asset or pool of assets, or part thereof, is transferred 

to the investors in the securities, securitisation fund units, other debt instruments and/or fi nancial 

derivatives issued by an entity that is separate from the originator and is created for or serves the 

purpose of the securitisation.

Settlement date: The date on which a transaction is settled. The settlement might take place on the 
same day as the trade (same-day settlement), or one or several days after the trade (the settlement 

date is specifi ed as the trade date (T) + the settlement lag).

Standardised Approach (SA): The standardised approach is the simplest of the three broad 
approaches to measuring credit risk. The other two approaches are based on banks’ internal rating 

systems. The standardised approach aligns regulatory capital requirements with the key elements of 

banking risk by introducing a wide differentiation of risk weights and a wide recognition of credit 

risk mitigation techniques, while avoiding excessive complexity. 

Statistics Committee (STC): An ESCB Committee of heads of statistics departments in EU central 
banks. The STC assists the ECB in all aspects of statistical work needed to support the performance 

of the ESCB’s tasks.

System of National Accounts (SNA): The System of National Accounts (SNA) is the internationally 
agreed standard set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity, 

broken down by economic sector of the entities undertaking the activity. The SNA comprises a 

coherent, consistent and integrated set of economic and fi nancial accounts in the context of a set of 

internationally agreed concepts, defi nitions, classifi cations and accounting rules. The SNA provides 

an overview of economic processes, recording how production is distributed among resident 

consumers, businesses, government and entities abroad. It shows how income originating in 

production, modifi ed by taxes and transfers, fl ows to these groups, how they allocate these fl ows to 

consumption, saving and investment, and their borrowing and lending transactions. The SNA also 

provides for balance sheets and accounts reconciling changes in balance sheets with transactions in 

the intervening period. The ESA is an adaptation of the SNA mandatory in the European Union. 

Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS): The UCITS 
Directive creates a harmonised framework for investment funds. It specifi es the core features of 

their operations and the fi nancial products they offer, such as risk diversifi cation, redemption of 

units on the request of unit-holders, regular valuation, and oversight by a depositary. It further 

clarifi es the application of the defi nition of transferable securities to closed-end funds and certain 

structured fi nancial instruments.

Reporting 
population 

All resident credit institutions and all 

other institutions (within MFI sector) 

which take deposits from and/or grant 

loans to households and/or 

non-fi nancial corporations resident 

in the participating member state 

comprise the potential reporting 

population. 

The potential reporting population 

does not include money market funds 

or central banks.

Data can be collected either from a 

census or, most often, from a sample 

of the potential reporting population.

Monetary fi nancial institutions 

(MFIs), comprising central banks, 

resident credit institutions as defi ned 

in Community Law and all other 

resident fi nancial institutions whose 

business is to receive deposits and/

or close substitutes for deposits 

from entities other than MFIs, and, 

for their own account, to grant 

credits and/or make investments in 

securities. It includes, in particular, 

money market funds (MMFs) and 

issuers of electronic money.

Credit institutions that, according 

to national supervisory rules, are 

required or allowed to use IAS/IFRS 

in the preparation of their consolidated 

fi nancial reports. 

As a minimum, all EU credit 

institutions whose securities are 

admitted to trading on a regulated 

market (listed) are required to use 

IAS/IFRS for their consolidated 

fi nancial statements according 

to Regulation EC 1606/2002. 

Consolidation 
scope

MFIs should consolidate (report) 

the business of all their offi ces (head 

offi ce and/or branches) located within 

the same national territory (“host” 

principle, i.e. only the business of 

resident MFIs, excluding foreign 

branches, is reported).

MFIs should consolidate (report) 

the business of all their offi ces 

(registered or head offi ce and/or 

branches) located within the same 

national territory. No consolidation 

for statistical purposes is permitted 

across national boundaries. The BSI 

reporting is defi ned on the basis of 

the so-called “host” principle, i.e. 

only the business of resident MFIs 

is reported.

From 2012 onwards, the consolidation 

scope is the Capital Requirements 

Directive for all the templates 

(it means that credit institutions 

and other fi nancial institutions are 

fully consolidated while insurance 

companies and non-fi nancial 

companies – if any – are be accounted 

for using the equity method). In 

addition, national supervisory 

authorities may collect a limited 

set of templates using the IFRS 

consolidation scope (all subsidiary 

institutions). FINREP follows the 

“home’ basis reporting concept, i.e. 

resident groups should report the 

business of non-resident branches 

and subsidiaries (consolidated 

accounting). 

National supervisory authorities may 

also decide to apply FINREP for 

solo reporting purposes, taking local 

specifi cities into account.

Data model NCBs must defi ne and implement 
the reporting arrangements to be 

followed by the actual reporting 

population in accordance with 

national characteristics. The NCBs 

must ensure that these reporting 

arrangements provide the statistical 

information required by MIR 

Regulation.

the reporting arrangements to be 

followed by the actual reporting 

population in accordance with

must ensure that these reporting 

arrangements provide the statistical

CEBS highly recommends the use of 

FINREP, although the framework is 

not mandatory. 

FINREP is a “Maximum Data 

Model”, which sets explicit minimum 

and maximum reporting requirements 

based on a common set of data 

defi nitions. Supervisors may neither 

modify the templates based on 

national need, nor require additional 

information that exceeds the proposed 

maximum.

FINREP includes core templates 

(balance sheet and income 

statement) and non-core templates. 

When FINREP is applied, all core 

information must be reported as a 

minimum.

EU credit institutions, investment fi rms 

and fi nancial intermediaries subject to the 

Directives 2006/48 (CRD) and 2006/49 

(CAD).

As a minimum, all EU credit institutions and 

investment fi rms.

Substantial overlap between the populations: 

credit institutions.

MMFs (and some other MFIs) are not 

obliged to use COREP.

Other non-MFI fi nancial institutions, as well 

as investment fi rms, may be requested to use 

COREP by supervisory authorities.

Non-MFIs like investment funds and other 

OFIs do not report MIR. 

Substantial overlap between the two 

populations: credit institutions.

MMFs and some other MFIs are not obliged 

to use IAS/IFRS in the preparation of their 

unconsolidated accounts.

Other non-MFI fi nancial institutions may 

be requested to use FINREP by supervisory 

authorities. 

The application of the framework on a solo 

or consolidated basis is currently a matter 

of national discretion. However, from 

2012 a uniform COREP for all countries 

will become compulsory for solo and 

consolidated reporting.

COREP follows the “home” basis reporting 

concept like FINREP, i.e. resident 

intermediaries or groups should also report 

the business of non-resident branches and 

subsidiaries.

MIR “host” basis reporting versus COREP 

and FINREP “home” basis reporting. 

Differences, in particular as regards the 

consolidation of non-resident branches 

(on a solo basis) and of domestic and foreign 

subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis).

BSI “host” basis reporting versus FINREP 

“home” basis reporting. 

Differences, in particular as regards the 

consolidation of non-resident branches and 

of domestic and foreign subsidiaries, except 

when FINREP is required for solo and on a 

host approach basis.

COREP formats will be uniform from 2012 

for solo and consolidated reporting.

Issue MFI interest rate 
requirements (MIR)

MFI balance sheet 
requirements (BSI)

FINREP (IFRS) approach

Main valuation 
criteria

Nominal amount (value) of loans 

and deposits in new business and 

outstanding amounts.

Market or fair valuation of fi nancial 

instruments is recommended, 

except for loans and deposits, where 

nominal amounts outstanding at the 

end of the month are mandatory. 

Despite this recommendation, the 

BSI Regulation is rather fl exible 

as regards the valuation method, 

making a general reference to 

Council Directive 86/635/EEC and 

any other international standards 

applicable (e.g. International 

Accounting Standards / International 

Financial Reporting Standards as 

endorsed by the European Union).

In FINREP, the valuation criteria are 

the IAS/IFRS measurement criteria. 

In particular, fi nancial assets 

(including loans) and fi nancial 

liabilities (including deposits) are 

recognised initially at fair value 

plus, in the case of fi nancial assets 

or liabilities not at fair value through 

profi t and loss, transaction costs 

that are directly attributed to the 

acquisition or issue of the fi nancial 

assets and liabilities. Subsequently, 

all fi nancial assets are to be measured 

at fair value, except for some items 

(e.g. the portfolios “loans and 

receivables” and “held-to-maturity”), 

which are measured at amortised cost 

using the effective interest method. 

In general, all fi nancial liabilities are 

subsequently measured at amortised 

cost using the effective interest 

method, except for fi nancial liabilities 

at fair value through profi t and loss, 

which are measured at fair value.

Time of recording Contract date for new business. 
For outstanding amounts, the same 

rules as for BSI apply, i.e. settlement 

date preferred but contract also 

allowed provided that it does not 

cause signifi cant distortions.

Transactions should be recorded at 

the settlement date (i.e. the date on 

which the payment is made).

Either trading date or settlement date 

accounting, provided that the chosen 

method is applied consistently for all 

purchases and sales of fi nancial assets 

that belong to the same category of 

fi nancial assets.

Treatment of 
accrued interest

No such concept in MIR new 

business. In MIR outstanding 

amounts, all interest rates are 

considered in the calculation of the 

interest rate regardless of whether 

they are only accrued or also paid. 

Nevertheless, the outstanding amount 

used in the weighting of the interest 

rates is the nominal amount 

(i.e. without taking into account the 

accrued interest).

Accrued interest should be subject 

to on-balance sheet recording as it 

accrues (accrual basis). Accrued 

interest on loans/deposits should be 

classifi ed, on a gross basis under 

“remaining assets”/”remaining 

liabilities”.

Accrual accounting is also required 

in the FINREP framework. Accrued 

interest not yet due should be reported 

with the underlying instrument in the 

balance sheet, i.e. should follow “dirty 

price” accounting. In the income 

statement, in the case of a fi nancial 

instrument at fair value through profi t 

and loss, accrued interest income 

and expenses may be reported either 

as part of interest income/expenses 

(“clean price”) or together with other 

gains and losses (under the “dirty” 

approach). 

Recognition and 
derecognition 

These concepts have no relevance 

in MIR new business. In MIR 

outstanding amounts, BSI criteria are 

followed.

Loans (assets) should be 

derecognised only when they expire 

or all risks and rewards of ownership 

are transferred. Generally, fi nancial 

derivatives are recognised on 

balance sheet at their fair value if 

MFIs follow IAS/IFRS (or National 

GAAPs are consistent with IAS/

IFRS) for their individual accounts; 

otherwise, they are recorded off-

balance sheet.

Financial assets should be 

derecognised when the contractual 

rights to the cash fl ows from a 

fi nancial asset expire or when the 

fi nancial asset is deemed to be 

transferred and that transfer qualifi es 

for derecognition 

(IAS 39, paragraphs 15-37).

the approach used. The rest of the assets are 

reported at their accounting value (art. 74 of 

the CRD).

Financial assets subject to capital 

requirements for market risk are reported at 

their fi nancial statement value. 

In MIR, the amount to be considered for the 

loans and deposits is the nominal; meanwhile 

in FINREP it is the fi nancial statement 

amount (amortised cost or fair value), and in 

COREP the original exposure amount and the 

related adjustments have to be reported. 

In FINREP and BSI it is possible to use the 

same valuation concepts, except for loans 

and deposits. 

In the BSI reporting scheme, loans and 

deposits should be reported at nominal value, 

whereas in FINREP these are generally 

recorded at amortised cost and could in 

certain restricted cases be recorded at fair 

value.

The same method as the one adopted in 

the fi nancial statement (for intermediaries 

adopting IAS/IFRS, either trading date or 

settlement date, provided that the chosen 

method is applied consistently for all 

purchases and sales of fi nancial assets that 

belong to the same category of fi nancial 

assets). 

The methods may be consistent if settlement 

date is applied in FINREP/COREP, or deviate 

if reporting institutions adopt trading date for 

FINREP/COREP purposes.

The methods may be consistent if settlement 

date is applied in FINREP, or deviate if 

reporting institutions adopt trading date for 

FINREP purposes.

The same method as the one adopted in 

the fi nancial statements (for intermediaries 

adopting IAS/IFRS, accrued interest should 

be reported with the underlying instrument in 

the balance sheet).

No direct link, as MIR here follows the BSI 

”clean price” principle while COREP and 

FINREP follow the ”dirty price” principle 

(i.e. accrued interest should be reported with 

the underlying instrument in the balance 

sheet).

[Not sure how relevant – MIR is about 

interest rates, not amounts of interest]

For both purposes, the principle of accruals 

accounting should be applied. The two 

reporting schemes differ, though, as regards 

the balance sheet allocation of accrued 

interest:

–  BSI requires the reporting of accrued 

interest of loans and deposits under 

remaining assets/liabilities, i.e. follows 

“clean price” accounting for the underlying 

instrument. The rest of the fi nancial 

instruments can be reported using the 

fi nancial statements amount.

–  FINREP requires the transmission of 

accrued interest of all fi nancial instruments 

with the underlying instrument in the 

balance sheet (“dirty price” accounting).

The same method as the one adopted in the 

fi nancial statement (for banks adopting 

IAS/IFRS, fi nancial assets should be 

derecognised when the contractual rights to 

the cash fl ows from a fi nancial asset expire 

or when the fi nancial asset is deemed to be 

transferred and that transfer qualifi es for 

derecognition).

For securitisation transactions, specifi c rules 

apply for the derecognition of the assets (the 

derecognition applies if a signifi cant part of 

the credit risk is transferred). 

For outstanding amounts, rules for 

recognition and derecognition of fi nancial 

assets and liabilities will be the same 

(if all risks and rewards have been fully 

transferred). 

Rules for recognition and derecognition 

of assets are quite similar for BSI and 

FINREP, including fi nancial derivatives and 

securitised loans (if all risks and rewards 

have been fully transferred). There are some 

deviations for partial transfer of risks and 

rewards, which have been addressed when 

developing MFI and FVC securitisation 

statistics.

Netting (offsetting) 
arrangements 

Gross recording should be applied.

Netting is only applicable to 

outstanding amounts which are taken 

from BSI. 

In BSI, for deposits and loans, 

net recording is permitted under 

restrictive conditions (same customer, 

currency and original maturity, 

enforceability by law). 

Gross reporting should be applied, 

in particular, to loans and deposits. 

A fi nancial asset may be offset 

against a liability and the net amount 

presented in the balance sheet when, 

and only when, an entity: (a) currently 

has a legally enforceable right to set 

off the recognised amounts; 

and (b) intends either to settle on a net 

basis, or to realise the asset and settle 

the liability simultaneously.

Treatment of 
impaired assets 
(basis of recording)

Bad loans, defi ned as “the total 

amount of loans in respect of which 

repayment is overdue or otherwise 

identifi ed as being impaired, partially 

or totally, in accordance with the 

defi nition of default in Directive 

2006/48/EC”, are excluded from MIR.

BSI Regulation requires loans 

to be recorded at the principal 

amount. This implies that they 

must be reported gross of all related 

provisions (impairment losses or 

amounts recorded in allowance 

accounts), except credit losses 

recorded as write-offs. NCBs may, 

however, allow the reporting of loans 

net of provisions, provided that such 

reporting practice is applied by all 

resident reporting agents and are 

necessary to maintain continuity in 

the statistical valuation of loans with 

the data reported for periods prior to 

January 2005.

Assets should be reported net of 

impairment losses. Either implicitly in 

the fair value accounting or, for assets 

valued at amortised cost, by reducing 

the balance sheet amount directly or 

using an allowance account. 

In the non-core tables of FINREP, 

there is information on the allowances 

accounts, for loans not measured at 

fair value through profi t or loss, 

and on the credit losses implicit in fair 

value changes, for loans measured at 

fair value through profi t or loss.

Residency 
breakdown

Residency covers only domestic and 

euro area (as a whole) residents.

BSI statistics require the following 

breakdown by residence of the 

counterparty: domestic, residents 

in other EMU countries, rest of 

the world, and not allocated (cash, 

fi xed assets, debt securities issued, 

capital and reserve, remaining 

liabilities). Additionally, it requires 

data “country by country” for 

some fi nancial assets and fi nancial 

liabilities when the counterparties are 

residents in EU countries.

In FINREP, the on-core Table 15 

provides the following geographical 

breakdown of assets and liabilities 

by residence of the counterparty: 

domestic, EMU countries, other EU 

countries, and the rest of the world. 

FINREP provides conventional 

criteria for the allocation of all assets 

and liabilities that must be classifi ed 

as not allocated in BSI Regulation. 

The breakdown is required by 

instruments and portfolios, but not by 

sector of the counterparty.

Key similarities and differences between 
BSI and FINREP

The same offsets as the one considered in the 

fi nancial statement. For IAS/IFRS, a fi nancial 

asset may be offset against a liability and the 

net amount presented in the balance sheet 

when, and only when, an entity:

(a) currently has a legally enforceable right 

to set off the recognised amounts; 

(b) intends either to settle on a net basis, 

or to realise the asset and settle the liability 

simultaneously. 

Furthermore, master netting agreements 

covering repurchase transactions and/

or securities or commodities lending or 

borrowing transactions and/or other capital 

market-driven transactions subject to annex 

VIII of CRD are considered.

The netting principles are identical except 

for cross-border transactions (netted under 

FINREP/COREP, gross under MIR), but this 

is not relevant because BSI applies the “host” 

principle, and potentially for master netting 

agreements covering repurchase transactions 

and/or securities or commodities lending.

The netting principles are practically 

identical, except that BSI establishes as 

additional criteria on the IAS/IFRS for 

offsetting credits and debits.

Furthermore, in FINREP, netting is possible 

among cross-border transactions, but this is 

not relevant because BSI applies the “host” 

principle.

In COREP, for fi nancial assets subject to 

credit risk capital requirements, the original 

exposure amount (the fi nancial statement 

value – IAS/IFRS or national GAAP – gross 

of value adjustments and provisions) and the 

“value adjustments and provisions associated 

with the original exposure” must be reported 

independently of the approach used.

CRD includes a defi nition of “default” loans 

for the IRB approach. For the standardised 

approach, there are defi nitions of “past 

due” (amounts overdue more than 90 days) 

and items belonging to regulatory high 

risk categories (this category can include 

impaired loans other than overdue more than 

90 days).

The defi nitions of bad loans in MIR and 

default loans in COREP are the same. 

Nevertheless, the defi nition of “default” 

in COREP applies only to loans subject 

to credit risk under the IRB approach, and 

many institutions apply the standardised 

approach.

Additionally, the defi nition of “default” 

is slightly different than the accounting 

defi nition of “impaired assets” plus “past 

due but not impaired assets (over 90 days)”, 

because a fi nancial asset must be qualifi ed 

as in “default” when it is considered that the 

obligor is unlikely to pay it in full “without 

recourse by the credit institution to actions 

such as realising security”, meanwhile for 

classifying a loan as impaired in FINREP it 

is necessary to have an impairment loss after 

considering the security. This difference is 

limited to those loans that are not past due 

over 90 days. 

In the BSI reporting scheme, loans should in 

principle be reported gross of all impairment 

allowances, although reporting net of 

specifi c impairments is implicitly permitted 

only when it had been [??] used for periods 

prior to January 2005.

In FINREP, they should be reported net of 

those allowances.

The bridging is possible at the loans level 

taking into account that in FINREP the 

allowances reported in non-core tables for 

loans not measured at fair value through 

profi t or loss and as proxy the cumulative 

change in the fair values attributable to 

changes in credit risk. 

Nevertheless, the bridging at the products 

level is limited to loans measured at 

amortised cost within the FINREP package. 

MIR and FINREP residency breakdowns are 

consistent.

BSI and FINREP residency breakdowns are 

consistent.

Counterpart sector 
breakdown

The classifi cation of institutions into

MIR covers only households 

(including NPISH) and non-fi nancial 

corporations.

The residency concept and the 

classifi cation of institutions into 

sectors follow, as far as possible, 

the equivalent ESA 95 concepts. 

Institutional units resident in an 

economy (usually a country or a 

group of countries, e.g. the euro 

area) are grouped into fi ve mutually 

exclusive institutional sectors, plus 

a number of subsectors, based on 

their principal functions, behaviour 

and objectives. Additionally, the 

economic relationships between 

residents and non-residents of that 

economy are recognised in the rest of 

the world sector.

Following the recent BSI update, the 

separate reporting of certain positions 

vis-à-vis a central counterparty 

and sole proprietors has been 

implemented in BSI.

The counterparty breakdown has 

been revised in order to facilitate 

the bridging with the Capital 

Requirements Directive 

(Art. 79 and 86) and the classifi cation 

adopted by the BSI Regulation. 

The economic sector allocation is 

based exclusively on the nature of the 

direct counterparty.

The FINREP framework provides a 

standardised counterparty breakdown 

in which fi nancial information is 

broken down into eight economic 

sector allocation classes.

The economic sector allocation is based 

on the nature of the direct counterparty, 

with an additional breakdown – in the 

case of loans held for non-fi nancial 

corporations and households – of 

those that meet the CRD defi nitions of 

corporates and retail.

Original and 
residual maturity 
breakdown

On outstanding amounts and 

new business, MIR requires the 

breakdown of loans and deposits 

by original maturity at inception or 

at issue. 

MIR also requires the classifi cation 

of loans in the new business 

statistics on the basis of their initial 

rate fi xation period.

For loans, deposits and debt 

securities, a breakdown by original 

maturity is required, i.e. the maturity 

at inception or at issue, with the 

exception of deposits redeemable at 

notice, where the notice period is the 

relevant maturity concept.

Following the recent BSI update, new 

breakdowns by remaining maturity 

[1, 2 years] and rate reset interval 

[12, 24 months] are requested.

FINREP has no reporting 

requirements on the maturity of 

the fi nancial instruments, but IFRS 

7 requires disclosure by residual 

maturity.

Instrument 
breakdown 

Separate identifi cation of deposits 

(overnight, with agreed maturity, 

redeemable at notice and repo) and 

loans (for consumption, for house 

purchases, for other purposes for 

households; by type of product – e.g. 

extended credit card – and by size of 

loan for non-fi nancial corporations).

In MIR, a given loan may only be 

included in one category.

Separate identifi cation on the assets 

side of the following: Cash/loans/

securities other than shares/MMF 

shares/units/shares and other equity/

fi xed assets/remaining assets.

Separate identifi cation on the 

liabilities side of the following: 

currency/deposits/MMF shares & 

units/debt securities issued/capital 

and reserves/remaining liabilities.

BSI requires an additional 

breakdown of the deposits by type 

of product: overnight, deposits with 

agreed maturity, redeemable at notice 

and repos.

Following the recent BSI update, 

new subcategories are requested: 

overdrafts, syndicated loans, 

convenience credit card credit and 

extended credit card credit, e-money, 

debt securities issued with nominal 

capital certainty at redemption in 

the currency of denomination below 

100%, transferable deposits.

FINREP breakdown by type of 

instruments:

Assets: cash/loans and advances/

debt securities/equity instruments/

derivatives held for trading /derivatives 

for hedging activity/tangible assets/

intangible assets/investments in entities 

accounted for using the equity method/

FINREP requires a “breakdown of

ANNEXES

COREP (CRD/CAD) approach Key similarities and differences between 
COREP, FINREP and MIR

Key similarities and differences between 
BSI and FINREP

COREP classifi es the assets subject to credit 

risk capital requirements among different 

“exposure classes” that are regulated by 

the Capital Requirements Directive (in 

particular, under Articles 79 and 86). 

The exposure classes are a mix between 

counterpart sector and instrument 

breakdowns. They generally specify a 

sector of counterpart for debt instruments 

(debt securities and loans and advances) 

but rather an instrument breakdown for 

equity and other assets. Nevertheless, in the 

standardised approach, debt instruments 

that meet some criteria must be included 

in specifi c exposure classed independently 

of the counterparty sector (e.g. past due, 

items belonging to the regulatory high risk 

category, and so on).

In the MIR framework, units resident in an 

economy are grouped into two institutional 

sectors.

In the COREP counterpart breakdown, units 

are grouped into exposure classes on the 

basis of their risk profi le, without regard to 

their residency. This is particularly relevant 

as regards the distinction between non-

fi nancial corporations and households.

In non-core templates of FINREP, loans and 

deposits are classifi ed into different sectors, 

among them fi nancial corporations and 

households.

In the BSI (ESA 95) framework, units 

resident in an economy are grouped into 

fi ve mutually exclusive institutional sectors 

based on their principal functions, behaviour 

and objectives. 

In the FINREP counterpart breakdown, 

sectors are grouped into eight classes on the 

basis of their economic nature. 

With the revised FINREP, reconciliation 

between the two reporting schemes is 

feasible. The main difference is that in 

FINREP the “other fi nancial corporations” 

sector could include investment fi rms that 

meet the BSI defi nition of MFIs.

Under the maturity-base approach of the 

standardised approach, debt instruments in 

the trading book are classifi ed on the basis 

of their residual maturity. 

MIR requires breakdown on original 

maturity and initial rate fi xation.

COREP and FINREP do not require the 

original maturity and initial rate fi xation 

period.

BSI requires original maturity, residual 

maturity, and rate reset interval 

breakdowns. FINREP has no reporting 

requirements.

For assets, COREP tables on credit risk do 

not require specifi cation of the type of asset 

to be reported in the heading “On-balance 

sheet items”, but this item must include the 

following type of instruments:

“Debt instruments” (debt securities and 

loans and advances) for tables that provide 

data on the exposure classes (in both SA and 

IRB approaches): Government, (and central 

banks), institutions, corporate and retail. 

“Equity instruments”, in table CR EQU IRB. 

For own funds: eligible capital (paid up 

capital, other instruments eligible as capital, 

etc.), eligible reserves, funds for general 

banking risks, other country-specifi c original 

own funds, additional own funds.

COREP does not include defi nitions of 

deposits and loans, although it shall be 

assumed that they are the same as those used 

for FINREP (as prudential data stem from the 

accounting framework – both IAS/IFRS and 

accounting directive regulations).

In COREP, a given loan may only be 

included once for the calculation of capital 

requirements (in an exposure class for credit 

risk or in a table for market risk).

The defi nition of deposits and their 

breakdown by type of product are the same 

in FINREP as in BSI/MIR.

FINREP includes, in Table 6.A (non-core), a 

breakdown of loans and advances by product 

whose defi nitions allow full bridging with 

the BSI defi nition of loans (see Annex 4.3 of 

the BSI-FINREP bridging report).

COREP does not include defi nitions of 

deposits and loans, although it stems from 

the accounting framework.

In the BSI/MIR Regulations, loans are 

broken down both by product and by 

purpose. In MIR, a given loan may only be 

included in one category.

In COREP, a given loan may only be 

included once for the calculation of capital 

requirements.

In FINREP, a “loan” or “advance” must only 

be reported in one of the categories of the 

breakdown by product. 

FINREP contains a breakdown between 

equity instruments/debt securities/loans and 

advances/etc. This breakdown has a clear 

bridging with the MFI fi rst-level breakdown 

loans/securities other than shares/shares and 

other equity/etc. 

Among other things, the bridging makes it 

possible to clarify the statistical classifi cation 

of certain accounting entries specifi ed in 

FINREP. 

Nevertheless, in FINREP there is a lack of 

data on the type of instruments classifi ed in 

the fi nancial statements under the specifi c 

categories of assets and liabilities 

“held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5 

(see comment on this issue).

Collateral/

For some types of new loans to NFCs 

and HHs. MIR Regulations request 

the identifi cation of the amount and 

interest rate relating to those secured 

by collateral (real estate or other 

collateral) and/or guarantees that meet 

some criteria. 

More specifi cally, the new Regulation 

states that “for the purpose of MFI 

interest rate statistics, the breakdown 

of loans according to collateral/

guarantees includes the total amount 

of new business loans which are 

collateralised using the “funded credit 

protection technique” as defi ned in 

Article 4(31) and Annex VIII, 

Part 1, Sections 6-25 of Directive 

2006/48/EC of the European 

Parliament and of the Council of 

14 June 2006 relating to the taking up 

and pursuit of the business of credit 

institutions (recast) and/or guaranteed 

using the “unfunded credit protection 

technique” as defi ned in Article 4(32) 

and Annex VIII, Part 1, 

Sections 29-26 of Directive 

2006/48/EC, in such a way that 

the value of the collateral and/or 

guarantee is higher than or equal to 

the total amount of the loan.” 

BSI requires a breakdown of loans 

that meet specifi c criteria according 

to real estate collateral.

More specifi cally, this breakdown 

includes loans which are real 

estate collateralised in accordance 

with VIII, Part 1, Sections 13-19 

of Directive 2006/48/EC, with an 
outstanding loan/collateral ratio 
of 1 or below 1. If these rules are 
not applied by the reporting agent, 

the determination of the loans to be 

included in this breakdown is based 

on the approach chosen to comply 

with capital requirements.

In FINREP, there is a breakdown 

by type of “loan and advances” 

which takes into account the type of 

collateral received in Table 6.A. 

(real estate and other collateral). 

Loans must be classifi ed as 

collateralised independently of their 

loan-to-value. 

FINREP does not refer directly to 

the CRD. Thus, mortgage loans 

(real estate collateralised) and other 

collateralised loans could include 

collateralised loans that are not 

eligible for capital requirements 

purposes. 

Additionally, FINREP includes, 

in Table 17, the notional of all 

guarantees received, regardless of 

whether they meet the CRD criteria 

for being eligible for solvency 

purposes, or are not guaranteeing 

loans. 

Furthermore, FINREP Table 6.B 

provides a breakdown of loans by 

collateral and guarantees for reporting 

the maximum collateral/guarantee that 

can be considered.

Securitisation and 
other transfers

In MIR there are no specifi c 

information requirements for 

securitisations and other transfers. 

Derecognition rules are the same as 

in BSI.

New BSI regulations require the 

reporting of specifi c tables with 

data on transferred loans, with 

distinction between traditional 

securitisations and other transfers. 

The data to be provided are net 

fl ows of loans transferred during 

the period, outstanding amounts of 

securitised loans not derecognised, 

and outstanding amounts of loans 

serviced in a securitisation broken 

down by sector and residence of the 

counterparty. 

BSI does not require data on 

synthetic securitisations.

The revised FINREP framework has 

information about securitisation and 

other types of transfer of fi nancial assets 

in the non-core Table 12 “Transfer 

of fi nancial assets”. Within this table, 

there is– for each IAS 39 portfolio – 

a breakdown by type of transfer 

(securitisation, repurchase agreement and 

rest) and by product (except for HTM 

and IFRS 5 – “held for sale”) disclosing 

the total amount of original assets not 

derecognised that has been securitised 

(and the associated liabilities). 

Additionally, there is data on the total 

amount of fi nancial assets entirely 

derecognised, for which the entity 

retains servicing rights and amounts 

derecognised exclusively for capital 

purposes. 

FINREP does not provide a defi nition 

of ‘securitisation’, although it can be 

assumed that the CRD defi nition of 

traditional securitisation applies. 

FINREP does not require data on 

synthetic securitisations. Nevertheless, 

Table 17 provides data on guarantees 

received (including derivatives) 

and Table 6.b provides data on the 

maximum collateral/guarantee that 

can be considered.

COREP (CRD/CAD) approach Key similarities and differences between 
COREP, FINREP and MIR

Key similarities and differences between 
BSI and FINREP

According to the CRD:

a) for intermediaries adopting the 

standardised approach, for credit risk, 

some exposures secured by mortgages on 

residential property or commercial real estate 

represent a specifi c exposure class 

(Annex VI, part 1, points 45-60 of Directive 

2006/48/EC);

b) for intermediaries adopting the SA or the 

FIRB approach, some real estate and other 

collateral constitute a specifi c type of funded 

credit protection (defi ned in annex VIII, part 

1, points 6-25 and subject to the minimum 

requirements laid down in annex VIII, part 2, 

point 14 of Directive 2006/48/EC);

c) for intermediaries adopting the AIRB 

approach, specifi c requirements for the 

recognition of some real estate in estimating 

own LGDs are provided for (annex VIII, part 

3, points 73-86 of Directive 2006/48/EC).

In general terms, the MIR framework and 

the COREP refer to common defi nitions of 

collateral and guarantees. 

More specifi cally, the new Regulation says 

“If an MFI applies a system different from the 

‘standardised approach’ as defi ned in Directive 

2006/48/EC for supervisory purposes, it may 

also apply the same in the reporting of loans 

included under this breakdown”.

Divergences between the two frameworks can 

arise with respect to the following aspects:

a) A divergence could emerge if the collateral 

was not considered eligible for capital purposes 

according to Annex VIII, Part 2, point 8 

(minimum requirements, e.g. in terms of legal 

certainty and monitoring of property values).

b) the MIR Regulation requires that the value 

of the collateral and/or guarantee is higher 

than or equal to the total amount of the loan; 

the CRD provides for with different impacts 

on the LGD, depending on the value of the 

ratio C/E (collateral/exposures) with respect 

to the thresholds C* and C** (Annex VIII, 

Part 3, points 62-72). 

FINREP classifi es loans as real estate 

collateralised or other collateralised loans 

when they are collateralised with that type of 

collateral, and the collateral independently 

meets: (i) the CRD criteria to be eligible 

for solvency purposes and (ii) the loan to 

value. Additionally, FINREP considers any 

guarantee received by the loans.

BSI framework uses the CRD defi nition of 

real estate collateral with a loan to value 

of 1 or below 1; meanwhile, in FINREP, 

mortgage loans include any real estate 

collateralised loans independently of the loan 

to value.

According to art. 4, point 36 of CRD, 

“securitisation” means a transaction or 

scheme, whereby the credit risk associated 

with an exposure or pool of exposures 

is tranched, having the following 

characteristics:

(a) payments in the transaction or scheme 

are dependent upon the performance of the 

exposure or pool of exposures; and

(b) the subordination of tranches determines 

the distribution of losses during the ongoing 

life of the transaction or scheme.

According to art. 4, point 37 of CRD, 

“traditional securitisation” means a 

securitisation involving the economic 

transfer of the exposures being securitised to 

a securitisation special purpose entity which 

issues securities. This is accomplished by 

the transfer of ownership of the securitised 

exposures from the originator credit 

institution or through sub-participation… 

According to art. 4, point 38 of CRD, 

“synthetic securitisation” means a 

securitisation where the tranching is 

achieved by the use of credit derivatives 

or guarantees, and the pool of exposures is 

not removed from the balance sheet of the 

originator credit institution.

There is no link between MIR, COREP and 

FINREP on data on securitisations and other 

transfers of loans.

BSI and FINREP require data on traditional 

securitisations and other transfers of loans.

COREP requires data on traditional and 

synthetic securitisations, but not on other 

transfers of loans.

FINREP does not provide a defi nition of 

securitisation, although it can be assumed 

that the CRD defi nition for traditional 

securitisations applies. This assumption 

could be clarifi ed in the FINREP framework.

MFI balance sheet 
requirements (BSI)

FINREP (IFRS) approach

Bad debt loans As mentioned above, bad loans, 
defi ned in BSI regulation as “the total 

amount of loans in respect of which 

repayment is overdue or otherwise 

identifi ed as being impaired, partially 

or totally, in accordance with the 

defi nition of default in Directive 

2006/48/EC”, are excluded from 

MIR.

BSI Regulation includes the 

defi nition of “bad debt loans that 

have not yet been repaid or written 

off” used in MFI interest rate 

requirements (MIR). Nevertheless, 

BSI does not require separated data 

on “bad debt loans”. 

The defi nition of impairment on 

fi nancial assets (“loans and advances”, 

“debt securities” and “equity 

instruments”) measured at amortised 

cost is reported in IAS 39, paragraphs 

58-70. FINREP provides information on 

past due and impaired loans in Table 7.

NB: The ED “Financial Instruments: 

Amortised Cost and Impairment” 

reports a clear defi nition of 

“non-performing” fi nancial assets 

(Appendix A): “The status of a fi nancial 

assets that is more than 90 days past due 

or is considered uncollectible”.

This proposed defi nition – if 

retained – could match with the 

COREP framework and thus with 

ECB regulations. 

FINREP does not require the amount 

of past due or impaired loans measured 

at fair value with changes through 

profi t or loss (although, non-core 

Tables 5.B and C provide the “amount 

of cumulative change in the fair values 

attributable to changes in credit risk”; 

this amount is different than the total 

amount of the impaired loan).

Non-current assets 
and disposal groups 
classifi ed as held for 
sale and Liabilities 
included in disposal 
groups classifi ed as 
held for sale

In MIR, loans and deposits must 

be included in the statistics 

independently of whether they meet 

the criteria to be classifi ed as “held 

for sale” in accordance to IFRS 5.

In BSI, loans, debt securities held, 

equity instruments, deposits and debt 

securities issued must be classifi ed in 

the relevant instrument independently 

of whether they meet the criteria to 

be classifi ed as “held for sale” in 

accordance with IFRS 5.

In FINREP, non-current assets and 

disposal groups classifi ed as held 

for sale, as well as the associated 

liabilities, are to be recognised 

separately from other items of assets 

and liabilities on the balance sheet 

(classifi cation according to IFRS 5 

provisions).

Nevertheless, FINREP does not 

provide a breakdown of this items by 

type of instrument (e.g., there is not 

data on loans, debt securities held, 

equity instruments, deposits and debt 

securities issued classifi ed as “held 

for sale”).

1) IFRS IG 7.21 states the following: “Paragraph 36 requires an entity to disclose information about its exposure to credit risk by class 
of fi nancial instrument. Financial instruments in the same class share economic characteristics with respect to the risk being disclosed 
(in this case, credit risk). For example, an entity might determine that residential mortgages, unsecured consumer loans, and commercial 
loans each have different economic characteristics.”

ANNEXES

COREP (CRD/CAD) approach Key similarities and differences between 
COREP, FINREP and MIR

Key similarities and differences between 
BSI and FINREP

According to art. 4, point 44 of CRD, 

“securitisation special purpose entity 

(SSPE)” means a corporation trust or 

other entity, other than a credit institution, 

organised for carrying on a securitisation 

or securitisations, the activities of 

which are limited to those appropriate 

to accomplishing that objective, the 

structure of which is intended to isolate the 

obligations of the SSPE from those of the 

originator credit institution, and the holders 

of the benefi cial interests in which have the 

right to pledge or exchange those interests 

without restriction.

For banks adopting the standardised 

approach, for credit risk, the following 

exposure classes include “bad debt loans”: 

“past due items” (amounts overdue more 

than 90 days, see annex VI, part 1, points 

61-65 of CRD) and “items belonging to 

regulatory high-risk categories”, which can 

include impaired loans other than past due; 

see annex VI, part 1, points 66-67 of CRD).

For banks adopting the IRB approaches for 

credit risk, this is the applicable defi nition of 

default (annex VII, part 4, points 44-48).

For loans subject to market risk, COREP 

does not require data on past due, 

impairment or default. 

The current defi nition of bad loans used in 

MIR matches the defi nition of default used 

in the COREP framework and in the CRD 

for capital requirements for credit risk under 

the IRB approaches. This defi nition is not 

used in COREP for the other loans. 

FINREP provides data exclusively on past 

due and impaired loans that are not measured 

at fair value through profi t and loss.

The CRD defi nition of “default” is slightly 

different from the accounting defi nition of 

“impaired assets” plus “past due but not 

impaired assets (over 90 days)”, because 

a fi nancial asset must be qualifi ed as in 

“default” when it is considered that the 

obligor is unlikely to pay it in full “without 

recourse by the credit institution to actions 

such as realising security”; meanwhile, for 

classifying a loan as impaired in accordance 

with IAS 39, it is necessary to have an 

impairment loss after considering the 

security. 

See previous comment on MIR.

In COREP, the loans, debt securities and 

equity instruments held must be classifi ed 

in the relevant exposure class for the 

calculation of the capital requirements for 

credit risk (or in the relevant market risk 

table) independently of whether they are 

classifi ed as “held for sale” in the fi nancial 

statements. 

The same is true of the debt instruments 

held or issued that must be included in 

the calculation of capital requirements for 

market risk.

In MIR and COREP, instruments must 

be classifi ed in the relevant instrument 

or exposure class (or market risk table), 

although they are classifi ed in FINREP as 

“held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5. 

FINREP does not provide a breakdown by 

type of instrument of “held-for-sale” assets 

and liabilities. 

The separate identifi cation of the two items 

stemming from IFRS 5 provisions creates 

diffi culties for bridging fi nancial instruments 

in MIR/BSI/COREP and FINREP unless 

this framework includes a breakdown by 

instrument similar to the ones available for 

fi nancial assets and fi nancial liabilities in the 

IAS 39 portfolios.

4 BRIDGING THE MFI BALANCE SHEETS REQUIREMENTS WITH FINREP EQUIVALENTS

Regarding items needed to reconcile the nominal amount of loans and deposits with their carrying 

amount in IAS/IFRS, Regulation ECB/2008/32 establishes that “accrued interest” is included in 

“Remaining assets” (“Remaining liabilities”), and “impairment losses” in “Capital and reserves”. 

The Regulation does not specify how the other items (fair value measurements, premiums/discounts 

in the acquisition or origination, etc.) should be classifi ed in the BSI scheme. For the purpose of 

its classifi cation system, the JEGR assumes that these balances are recorded under “Capital and 

reserves”. The JEGR also recommends that the forthcoming update of the MFI guidance notes 

includes a clarifi cation on this matter.23456

4.2 BRIDGING BETWEEN LOANS AND ADVANCES (FINREP) AND LOANS (BSI REGULATION)

The bridging below compares the defi nitions and measurement criteria used in FINREP Guidelines 

related to “loans and advances” with the defi nitions and measurement criteria used in BSI regulation 

related to “loans”. 

1) Definition of “loans and advances” (FINREP) and “loans” (BSI regulation)

In accordance with FINREP defi nitions, the instrument “loan” in BSI is equal to the instrument 

“loans and advances” of FINREP, except those “advances that cannot be classifi ed as ‘loans’ 

according to the ECB Regulation”.7 Consequently, FINREP includes a product breakdown in 

Table 6.A that reports a specifi c item for the advances that cannot be classifi ed as loans (“Loans and 

advances – Other”). 

1 The sign of the items relate to assets. 

2 Only applicable to loans included in the available-for-sale category.

3 Applicable only for hybrid instruments included in the categories of fi nancial instruments at fair value through profi t and loss. Other 

embedded derivatives are separated from the host contracts (IAS39.11) and separately presented in FINREP in the items “derivatives held 

for trading” or “derivatives – hedge accounting”.

4 When they are an integral part of the effective interest rate of the fi nancial instrument, according to IAS 18 (Appendix 14.a (i)).

5 In fair value hedges, the carrying amount of the hedged item must be adjusted by the amount of the gain or loss attributable to the hedge 

risk (IAS 39.89).

6 When they are an integral part of the effective interest rate of the fi nancial instrument, according to IAS 18 (Appendix 14.a (i)).

7 These advances are to be classifi ed as “Remaining assets” in BSI.



96
ECB

MFI balance sheet and interest rate statistics and EBA guidelines on FINREP and COREP/Large Exposures

March 2012

FINREP Guidelines state that debt instruments held that meet the defi nition of loans in accordance 

with the ECB Regulation cannot be classifi ed as debt securities even if classifi ed as securities from 

a “legal perspective” (see par. 33 of Chapter II).

FINREP provides data on all loans and advances, except when they are classifi ed as “Non-current 

assets and disposal groups classifi ed as held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5, because no 

breakdown is available for this aggregated item in the revised framework. 

FINREP Table 10.A includes the item “Short positions – Loans and advances” that – although 

it is very rare to have short positions on loans – should be deducted from loans and advances to 

reconcile the two defi nitions. 

2) Breakdown on the basis of their characteristics 

Both FINREP and BSI Regulation include breakdowns of loans on the basis of their characteristics. 

FINREP provides a breakdown of “loans and advances” in Table 6.A on the basis of a mix of the 

following characteristics/attributes: collateral, type of product, counterpart and purpose. 

To avoid overlapping in the classifi cation of a single loan, FINREP Guidelines establish a hierarchy 

for the different attributes. Loans are to be classifi ed according to the collateral: if they are 

collateralised, they must be allocated in accordance with the type and way in which the collateral 

is reported (“mortgage loans”, “other collateralised loans”, “fi nance leases” or “reverse repurchase 

loans”).

Non-collateralised loans granted on the basis of bills or other documents that give the right to 

receive the proceeds of transactions for the sale of goods or provision of services must be classifi ed 

as “trade receivables”.

The other loans are to be classifi ed according to the purpose: if granted for consumption, they are 

to be classifi ed as “consumer credit”; otherwise, they must be classifi ed according to maturity 

(“on demand” or “other term loans”).

FINREP also includes, as a memorandum item, the amount of the “collateralised credit for 

consumption”, which reports the loans given with this purpose classifi ed as collateralised. 

Nevertheless, FINREP does not include information on loans for consumption that are classifi ed 

as “trade receivables” (e.g. some cases of factoring without recourse when the obligor is a 

household).

The BSI Regulation classifi es the loans on the basis of the same FINREP attributes, except for 

the origin of the loan (i.e. if they are “trade receivables”). Nevertheless, in the BSI Regulation, 

the classifi cation in the different attributes is pure; thus, for BSI purposes, a given loan could be 

included simultaneously in several BSI items (e.g. it could be reported in both real estate collateral 

and revolving credits). 

Some BSI Regulation defi nitions are not used for FINREP (Syndicated loans, Holdings of non-

negotiable securities, Traded loans and loans granted on a trust basis), and some FINREP defi nitions 

are not used for BSI Regulation (trade receivables).

March 2012

Table 1 provides a comparison between the defi nitions included in both frameworks to help 

reporting agents in the bridging between BSI statistical and FINREP items. This table states that 

there is a possible need for improvements in the following defi nitions included in FINREP:

The item “on demand (call) and short notice (current account)” should identify “short notice” a) 

loans with “current accounts”; meanwhile, in the BSI Regulation both types of loans are 

different. “Current accounts” are “Overnight deposits” in the BSI framework, and “Short 

notice” loans can be identifi ed with the “deposits redeemable at notice” of the BSI Regulation. 

The latter should be classifi ed as “other term loans” in FINREP, as they are available (in term of 

maturity) after a period of time from the notice. In addition, FINREP does not defi ne the “short” 

term, although IFRS defi nes the “short” term as up to 12 months (but this defi nition should not 

be retained for this item).

The item “Other term loans” also includes “interbank deposits (transferable or not)”, while b) 

the BSI Regulation states that “transferable” deposits are “those deposits within the category 

‘overnight deposits’ which are directly transferable on demand to make payments to other 

economic agents by commonly used means of payment”. Consequently, the reference in FINREP 

to “transferable or not” related to term loans should be dropped, because all term deposits are 

not transferable. 

3) Classification on the basis of loan status: “impaired” (FINREP) and “bad debt” (BSI Regulation)

The BSI Regulation defi nes “bad debt loans” as “the total amount of loans in respect of which 

repayment is overdue or otherwise identifi ed as being impaired, partially or totally, in accordance 

with the defi nition of default in Directive 2006/48/EC”. This Directive defi nes “default” on loans – 

for banks using the IRB approach for credit risk capital requirements – when:

the credit institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its obligations without recourse 1. 

by the credit institution to actions such as realising security (if held); or

the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the credit 2. 

institution. 

The BSI defi nition of “bad debt loans” applies to all loans disregarding the portfolio in which 

they are classifi ed in the fi nancial statements or how they are treated for solvency purposes. BSI 

Regulation does not require specifi c data on “bad debt loans”; nevertheless, the BSI defi nition is 

used for the MIR statistics, where bad loans are not included in the weighted average interest rates. 

FINREP does not include any information on the amount past due or on the impaired loans measured 

at fair value with changes through profi t or loss (although Tables 5.B and C provide the “amount of 

cumulative change in the fair values attributable to changes in credit risk”). 

Nevertheless, FINREP provides a link with the statistical concept of “bad debt loans” in Table 7 – 

‘Information on impairment and past due’ for loans and advances classifi ed in the IAS 39 categories 

of available-for-sale, loans and receivables and held-to-maturity, because this table includes a 

breakdown of ‘loans and advances’ from a credit risk point of view. The relevant information is 

included in the columns “past due but not impaired (over 90 days)”, “net carrying amount of the 

impaired assets” plus their allowances (“specifi c allowances for individually assessed fi nancial 

assets”, “specifi c allowances for collectively assessed fi nancial assets” and “collective allowances 

for incurred but not reported losses”).

ECB

In FINREP, loans and advances are classifi ed as “impaired” according to IAS 39 provisions.

The Capital Requirements Directive defi nition of “default” is slightly different from the defi nition 

of “impaired assets” plus “past due but not impaired assets (over 90 days)”, because a fi nancial 

asset must be qualifi ed as in “default” when it is considered that the obligor is unlikely to pay it in 

full “without recourse by the credit institution to actions such as realising security”; meanwhile, 

for classifying a loan as impaired, it is necessary to have an impairment loss after considering the 

security.

collateralised. In FINREP, when these types of 
loans are collateralised, they must be classifi ed as 
“mortgage loans” or “other collateralised loans” 
depending on the collateral.]

Revolving loans are loans that have all the following 

features: 1) the borrower may use or withdraw funds 

up to a pre-approved credit limit without giving prior 

notice to the lender; 2) the amount of available credit 

can increase and decrease as funds are borrowed and 

repaid; 3) the credit may be used repeatedly; 4) there is 

no obligation to make regular repayment of funds.

Revolving loans include the amounts obtained 

through a line of credit and not yet repaid (outstanding 

amounts). A line of credit is an agreement between 

a lender and borrower that allows a borrower to take 

advances, during a defi ned period and up to a certain 

limit, and repay the advances at his discretion before 

a defi ned date. (…) Revolving loans (…) exclude 

loans provided through credit cards. The total amount 

owed by the borrower is to be reported, irrespective 

of whether it is within or beyond any limit agreed 

beforehand between the lender and the borrower with 

regard to size and/or maximum period of the loan.

This category also includes 

interbank deposits, whether 

transferable or not, and other 

fi xed-term fi nancial support.

[Note: BSI Regulation establishes that “transferable” 
deposits are exclusively “those deposits within the 
category ‘overnight deposits’ which are directly 
transferable on demand to make payments to other 
economic agents by commonly used means of payment”. 
Consequently, the reference in FINREP to “transferable

an agreed fi xed term or that can only be converted into 

currency before that agreed term provided the holder is 

charged some kind of penalty. This item also includes 

administratively regulated savings deposits where the 

maturity related criterion is not relevant (…). Although 

deposits with agreed maturity may feature the possibility 

of earlier redemption after prior notifi cation, or may 

be redeemable on demand subject to certain penalties, 

these features are not considered to be relevant for 

classifi cation purposes.

exercised after all claims with a higher status 

(e.g. deposits/loans) have been satisfi ed, giving them 

some of the characteristics of “shares and other 

equity”. For statistical purposes, subordinated debt is 

to be classifi ed as either “loans” or “securities other 

than shares” according to the nature of the fi nancial 

instrument.

“project fi nance” (loans that are 

recovered solely from the income 

of the projects fi nanced by them).

N/A

Mortgage loans 

(Real estate 

collateralized 

loans)

Includes loans formally backed 

by real estate collateral.

Loans with Real 

estate collateral

For the purpose of this reporting scheme, the 

breakdown of loans according to real estate collateral 

includes the total amount of outstanding loans which 

are collateralised in accordance with VIII, Part 1, 

Sections 13-19 of Directive 2006/48/EC, with an 

outstanding loan/collateral ratio of 1 or below 1. 

If these rules are not applied by the reporting agent, 

the determination of the loans to be included in this 

breakdown is based on the approach chosen to comply 

with capital requirements.

N/A [Note: FINREP does not refer directly to Directive 
2006/48/EC. Thus, the item Mortgage loans includes 

any real estate collateralised loan disregarding its 

loan-to-value-ratio.]

Other 

collateralised 

loans

Includes loans formally backed 

by collateral other than “real 

estate collateralised loans”, 

“fi nance leases” and “reverse 

repurchase loans” (e.g. pledges 

of securities, cash, or other 

collateral). 

N/A [Note: the BSI Regulation does not include a defi nition 
and does not require specifi c data on this type of 

loan, but the MIR Regulation requires data on other 

collateralised loans that meet some criteria to be 

eligible for prudential purposes.] 

Trade 

receivables

Includes loans to other debtors 

granted on the basis of bills or 

other documents that give the 

right to receive the proceeds 

of transactions for the sale of 

goods or provision of services. 

This item includes all factoring 

transactions (both with and 

without recourse).

Financial leases 

granted to third 

parties

[Note: the BSI regulation includes this defi nition, but it 
does not require specifi c data.]

Financial leases are contracts whereby the legal 

owner of a durable good (“lessor”) lends these assets 

to a third party (“lessee”) for most if not all of the 

economic lifetime of the assets, in exchange for 

instalments covering the cost of the good plus an 

imputed interest charge. The lessee is in fact assumed 

to receive all of the benefi ts to be derived from 

the use of the good and to incur the costs and risks 

associated with ownership. For statistical purposes, 

fi nancial leases are treated as loans from the lessor to 

the lessee (enabling the lessee to purchase the durable 

good). The assets (durable goods) which have been 

lent to the lessee are not recorded anywhere on the 

MFI’s balance sheet.

Reverse 

repurchase loans

Includes fi nance granted in 

exchange for securities bought 

under repurchase agreements 

or borrowed under securities 

lending agreements.

Claims under 

reverse repos 

or securities 

borrowing against 

cash collateral

Counterpart of cash paid out in exchange for securities 

purchased by reporting agents, or securities borrowing

does not include those loans that qualify to be 
classifi ed as FINREP Mortgage loans or Other 
collateralised loans. These loans are classifi ed in 
the memorandum item “collateralised credit for 
consumption”. Additionally, the item Credit for 
consumption does not include the loans that meet 
the defi nition of “trade receivables”, although 
their purpose is credit for consumption (e.g. some 
factoring transactions without recourse). In the BSI 
Regulation, Credit for consumption includes all loans 
granted for this purpose.]

Credit for consumption (loans granted for the purpose 

of mainly personal use in the consumption of goods 

and services). Credit for consumption granted to sole 

proprietors/unincorporated partnerships is comprised 

in this category if the reporting MFI knows that the 

loan is predominantly used for personal consumption 

purposes.

as well as credit granted 

to “retail”, “non-fi nancial 

corporates”, and “other fi nancial 

corporations” using delayed debit 

cards or credit cards 

(ECB Regulation).

Credit card debt [Note: In FINREP, Credit card debt includes credit 
granted to “retail”, “non-fi nancial corporations”, and 
“other fi nancial corporations”. In the BSI Regulation, 
information on Credit card debt is required only for 
credit granted to “households” or” non-fi nancial

For the purpose of this Regulation, this category 

comprises credit granted to households or non-fi nancial 

corporations either via delayed debit cards (i.e. cards 

providing convenience credit as defi ned below) or via 

credit cards (i.e. cards providing convenience credit 

and extended credit). Credit card debt is recorded on 

dedicated card accounts and therefore not evident on 

current or overdraft accounts. Convenience credit 

is defi ned as the credit granted at an interest rate of 

0% in the period between the payment transaction(s) 

effectuated with the card during one billing cycle and 

the date at which the debit balances from this specifi c 

billing cycle become due. Extended credit is defi ned as 

the credit granted after the due date(s) of the previous 

billing cycle(s) has/have passed, i.e. debit amounts on 

the card account that have not been settled when this 

was fi rst possible, for which an interest rate or tiered 

interest rates usually greater than 0% are charged. 

Often minimum instalments per month have to be 

made, to at least partially repay extended credit.

The counterpart to these forms of credit is the entity 

liable to eventually repay the amounts outstanding 

in accordance with the contractual agreement, which 

coincides with the cardholder in the case of privately 

used cards, but not in the case of company cards.

N/A [Note: the FINREP breakdown 
of loans does not include the 
item “syndicated loan”; they are 
included under the item “Other 
term loans” or other items when 
feasible (e.g. collateralised 
loans).

Syndicated loans 

(single loan 

agreements, 

in which several 

institutions 

participate as 

lenders) 

Syndicated loans only cover cases where the borrower 

knows, from the loan contract, that the loan is made 

by several lenders. For statistical purposes, only 

amounts actually disbursed by lenders (rather than 

total credit lines) are regarded as syndicated loans. The 

syndicated loan is usually arranged and coordinated 

by one institution (often called the “lead manager”) 

and is actually made by various participants in the 

syndicate. Participants, including the lead manager, 

all report their share of the loan vis-à-vis the borrower 

(i.e. not vis-à-vis the lead manager) in their balance 

sheet assets.

N/A [Note: in the FINREP 
framework, debt instruments 
that meet the defi nition of loans 
in accordance with the BSI 
Regulation cannot be classifi ed 
as debt securities even though 
they are securities from a legal 
point of view.

Holding of 

non-negotiable 

securities

[Note: the BSI Regulation includes this defi nition, but 
it does not require specifi c data.]
Holdings of securities other than shares and other 

equity which are not negotiable and cannot be traded 

on secondary markets, see also “traded loans”.

which they are represented 
(e.g. mortgage loan, fi nance 
lease, etc.).]

Traded loans [Note: the BSI regulation includes this defi nition, but it 
does not require specifi c data.]
Loans that have de facto become negotiable are to be 
classifi ed under the asset item “loans” provided they 

continue to be evidenced by a single document and are, 

as a general rule, only traded occasionally.

4.3 BRIDGING THE BSI REQUIREMENTS WITH FINREP EQUIVALENT

3) Bridging the BSI and FINREP instrument breakdowns 

This table describes the coverage of the instrument from the side of the BSI and lists the best 

matching FINREP items (from Tables 1.1 to 1.3 and other non-core tables). This exercise is 

complicated by the differences in the structure of the two reporting schemes, as well as by the 

low level of instrument detail in the FINREP balance sheet. The JEGR has developed a relational 

database in MS Access in order to formalise this bridging.

“Type of loans and advances – Other”. This item includes • 

advances that cannot be classifi ed as “loans” according to 

ECB/2008/32 (disregarding IAS 39 classes of fi nancial asset).

The following amount should be subtracted: 

The difference between the carrying amount of the loans and • 

their principal amount outstanding.

Notes:
1) FINREP “Loans and receivables – loans and advances” does 

not include BSI “securities other than shares” because debt 

securities which can be traded in secondary markets (even 

only sporadically) shall be classifi ed as “debt securities” 

(and never as “loans and advances”).

2) Table 6.A of FINREP provides a breakdown of “all” loans 

and advances by product, except those classifi ed as “Non-

current assets and disposal groups classifi ed as held for sale”. 

This means this table includes loans and advances reported 

under “Demand deposits and cash equivalents” and under all 

IAS 39 portfolios.

3) “Loans and advances” include fi nancial assets that do not 

meet the defi nition of loans according to ECB Regulations 

(e.g. gross amounts receivable in respect of suspense and 

transit items). These fi nancial assets that are included in the 

breakdown of loans and advances by product of Table 6.A of 

FINREP in the item “Other” should be classifi ed under the 

category “remaining assets” of BSI.

4) FINREP includes in Table 10. A an item for “short 

positions – Loans and advances” (rare to have in practice). 

5) As for the reconciliation between the principal amount of 

loans  and their carrying amount according to IAS/IFRS, 

Regulation ECB/2008/32 establishes that “accrued interest 

incomes” (recorded together with the underlying instrument 

within FINREP) shall be included in “Remaining assets”, 

while “impairment losses” shall be recorded in “Capital and 

reserves”. The BSI scheme does not clarify the classifi cation 

of other items (fair value measurements, premiums/discounts 

in the acquisition or origination, etc.). For the purpose of its 

classifi cation system, the JEGR assumes that these balances 

are recorded under the item “Capital and reserves”. The 

JEGR also recommends that the forthcoming update of the 

MFI guidance notes includes a clarifi cation on this matter.

6) FINREP includes the following data on “impairment losses 

(allowances)” and “cumulative change in the fair values 

attributable to changes in the credit risk” that must be 

included under “Capital and reserves” in BSI:

Breakdown of demand deposits and cash equivalents – Loans • 

and advances” (table 5.A). The amount of cumulative 

allowances for impairment losses is not available, although 

the expectation is that there is not impairment for these 

loans (because of the inclusion within the concept of “cash 

equivalents”). 

“Financial assets held for trading – loans and advances”. • 

The amount of cumulative change in the fair values attributable 

to changes  in the credit risk is available in Table 5.B; 

“Financial assets designated at fair value through profi t or •

in the fair values attributable to changes in the credit risk is

there is not a breakdown between loans and advances and debt 

securities, but it can be derived from table 7 in which there is

Securities other than shares

Holdings of securities other than shares or other equity (debt 

securities), which are negotiable and usually traded on secondary 

markets or can be offset in the market, and which do not grant 

the holder any ownership rights over the issuing institution. This 

includes:

Holdings of securities which give the holder the unconditional • 

right to a fi xed or contractually determined income in the form 

of coupon payments and/or a stated fi xed sum at a specifi ed 

date (or dates) or starting from a date defi ned at the time of 

issue;

Negotiable loans that have been restructured into a large • 

number of identical documents and can be traded on secondary 

markets;

Subordinated debt in the form of debt securities;• 

Debt securities lent out under securities lending operations • 

should remain on the original owner’s balance sheet; 

Convertible bonds, as long as they have not been converted. • 

Where separable from the underlying bond, the conversion 

option should be regarded as a separate fi nancial asset 

(derivative);

“Short selling” – the sale of a fi nancial asset not currently • 

held on-balance sheet – should be recorded as a negative 

position in debt securities. This treatment is designed to avoid 

duplications.

The following items of Tables 1.1 and 5.A should be added 

(consistent with the defi nition of “debt securities”): 

“Demand deposits and cash equivalents – debt securities” • 

(table 5.A);

“Financial assets held for trading – debt securities” (Table 1.1 • 

or 5.B);

“Financial assets designated at fair value through profi t or • 

loss – debt securities” (table 1.1 or 5.C);

“Available-for-sale fi nancial assets – debt securities” (Table 1.1 • 

or 5.D);

“Loans and receivables – debt securities” (Table 1.1 or 5.E);• 

“Held-to-maturity investments – debt securities” (Table 1.1);• 

Debt securities included in “Non-current assets and disposal • 

groups classifi ed as held for sale” (Table 1.1). This amount is 

not separately available in FINREP.

The following items of Table 1.2 should be subtracted: 

“Financial liabilities held for trading – short positions” – Debt 

securities.

Table 10 includes a distinction (not included in Table 1.2) • 

between “Short positions – In equity instruments” and “Short 

positions – In fi xed income instruments”.

Note: When an entity securitises a loan through an FVC but does 

not derecognise the loan for accounting purposes, a new liability 

in the form of a deposit is recognised for the consideration 

received. When the entity buys securities issued by the FVC, 

according to BSI rules, this entity has to recognise these securities 

as an asset; meanwhile, in accordance with IAS 39, it should 

offset the liability to avoid the duplication of assets. Thus, the 

treatment in the BSI rules is different from the treatment applied 

in FINREP, where these securities are not recognised in the asset 

side but subtracted in the liability side previously recognised for 

the consideration received.

Money market fund shares/units

Holdings of shares/units issued by MMFs. MMFs are CIU whose 

shares/units are, in terms of liquidity, close substitutes for deposits 

and which primarily invest in money market instruments and/or 

in MMF shares/units and/or in other transferable debt instruments 

with a residual maturity of up to and including one year, and/

or in bank deposits, and/or which pursue a rate of return that 

approaches the interest rates of money market instruments.

Parts of the following items of Tables 1.1 and 5.A should be 

added (only those parts issued by MMFs): 

“Demand deposits and cash equivalents – equity instruments” • 

issued by MMFs (table 5.A);

“Financial assets held for trading – equity instruments” • 

(Table 1.1 or 5.B) issued by MMFs;

Shares and other equity

Holdings of securities which represent property rights in

Of which: fi nancial derivatives

Financial derivative instruments that have a market value 

should be subject to on-balance sheet recording. They have 

a market value when they are traded on organised markets 

or in circumstances in which they can be regularly offset on 

non-organised over-the-counter markets. Derivatives should be 

recorded on a gross basis; therefore, derivative contracts with 

gross positive market values should be recorded on the asset side. 

Note: Notional amounts should not be entered as on-balance sheet 
items. 

The following items of Table 1.1 should be added: 

“Financial assets held for trading – derivatives held for •

Of which: accrued interest

Accrued interest on the category “loans”, i.e. interest that is 

receivable on the balance sheet reporting date, but which is not 

due to be received until a future date, is to be classifi ed on a gross 

basis under this category. Accrued interest is to be excluded from 

the loan to which it relates, which should be valued at the nominal 

amount outstanding on the reporting date.

In FINREP, accrued interest is recorded together with the 

underlying instrument. 

Table 2 Liabilities

BSI requirement FINREP “equivalent”

Deposits

Amounts owed to creditors by reporting agents, other than those 

arising from the issue of negotiable securities. This category also 

covers loans as liabilities of MFIs. 

Non-negotiable debt instruments issued by reporting agents are 

generally to be classifi ed in this category. Instruments may be 

referred to as being “non-negotiable” in the sense that there are 

restrictions to the transfer of legal ownership of the instrument, 

which means that they cannot be marketed or, although 

technically negotiable, they cannot be traded owing to the absence 

of an organised market. Non-negotiable instruments issued by 

reporting agents that subsequently become negotiable and that 

can be traded on secondary markets should be reclassifi ed in the 

category “debt securities”; syndicated loans received by MFIs fall 

under this category.

The following items of Table 1.2 should be added: 

“Financial liabilities held for trading – deposits”;• 

“Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profi t and • 

loss – deposits”;

Margin deposits (margins) made under derivative contracts should 

be classifi ed in this category, where they represent cash collateral 

deposited with MFIs and where they remain in the ownership of 

the depositor and are repayable to the depositor when the contract 

is closed out. On the basis of current market practice, it is also 

suggested that margins received by the reporting agent should 

only be classifi ed as deposits to the extent that the MFI is provided 

with funds that are freely available for on-lending. Where a part 

of the margin received by the MFI has to be passed to another 

derivatives market participant (e.g. the clearing house), only that 

part which remains at the disposal of the MFI should in principle 

be classifi ed as deposits. The complexities of current market 

practice may make it diffi cult to identify those margins that are 

truly repayable, because different types of margin are placed 

indistinguishably within the same account, or those margins that 

provide the MFI with resources for on-lending. In these cases, 

it is acceptable to classify these margins under the category 

“remaining liabilities” or as deposits, according to national 

practice; “earmarked balances related to e.g. leasing contracts” 

are classifi ed as deposits under “deposits with agreed maturity” 

or “deposits redeemable at notice”, depending on the maturity/

provisions of the underlying contract.

For the purposes of the reporting scheme, this category is further 

broken down into: 

Overnight deposits - Deposits which are convertible into • 

currency and/or which are transferable on demand by 

cheque, banker’s order, debit entry or similar means, without 

signifi cant delay, restriction or penalty. Balances representing 

prepaid amounts in the context of electronic money issued 

by MFIs, either in the form of “hardware based” e-money 

(e.g. prepaid cards) or “software based” e-money, are included 

under this item. This item excludes non-transferable deposits 

which are technically withdrawable on demand but which are 

subject to signifi cant penalties.

(of which Transferable deposits) - Transferable deposits are • 

those deposits within the overnight deposits category, which 

are directly transferable on demand to make payments to other 

economic agents by commonly used means of payment, such 

as credit transfer and direct debit, possibly also by credit or 

debit card, e-money transactions, cheques, or similar means, 

without signifi cant delay, restriction or penalty. Deposits that 

can only be used for cash withdrawal and/or deposits from 

which funds can only be withdrawn or transferred through 

another account of the same owner are not to be included as 

transferable deposits.”

Deposits with agreed maturity – Non-transferable deposits • 

which cannot be converted into currency before an agreed 

fi xed term or that can only be converted into currency before 

that agreed term provided the holder is charged some kind of 

penalty. This item also includes administratively regulated 

savings deposits where the maturity-related criterion is not 

relevant. Financial products with roll-over provisions must be 

classifi ed according to the earliest maturity. Although deposits 

with agreed maturity may feature the possibility of earlier 

redemption after prior notifi cation, or may be redeemable on 

demand subject to certain penalties, these features are not 

considered to be relevant for classifi cation purposes.

Financial liabilities held for trading, designated at fair value 

through profi t and loss and measured at amortised cost, except 

those classifi ed as “held for sale”, are further broken down by 

type of deposit (overnight deposits, deposits with agreed maturity, 

deposits redeemable at notice and other deposits), as specifi ed in 

Regulation ECB/2008/32, in Table 10.A.

Note: (1) When available, accrued interest expenses on deposits 
and loans taken should be removed from this category and 

classifi ed on a “gross basis” under the category “remaining 

liabilities” in the ECB Regulation. However, in FINREP, 

accrued interest expense is recorded together with the underlying 

instrument.

(2) When an entity securitises a loan through a FVC but does not 

derecognise the loan for accounting purposes, a new liability in 

the form of a deposit is recognised for the consideration received. 

When the entity buys securities issued by the FVC, according 

to BSI rules, this entity has to recognise these securities as an 

asset; meanwhile, in accordance with IAS 39, it should offset the 

liability to avoid the duplication of assets. Thus, the treatment in 

the BSI rules is different than the treatment applied in FINREP, 

where these securities are not recognised in the asset side but 

subtracted in the liability side previously recognised for the 

consideration received. 

(3) As for the reconciliation between the principal amount of 

deposits and their carrying amount in IAS/IFRS, Regulation 

ECB/2008/32 establishes that “accrued interest expenses” must 

be included in “Remaining liabilities”. The Regulation does not 

specify how the other items (fair value measurements, premiums/

discounts on origination, etc.) should be classifi ed in the BSI 

scheme. For the purpose of its classifi cation system, the JEGR 

assumes that these balances are recorded under “Capital and 

reserves”. The JEGR also recommends that the forthcoming 

update of the MFI guidance notes includes a clarifi cation on this 

matter.

(4) In FINREP, embedded derivatives included in hybrid 

instruments are separated from the host contracts (IAS 39.11) 

and recognised under items “derivatives held for trading” or 

“derivatives – hedge accounting”. Only hybrid instruments 

included in the categories at fair value through profi t or loss are 

not segregated from the host contracts.

Table 2 Liabilities (cont’d)

BSI requirement FINREP “equivalent”

Deposits redeemable at notice – Non-transferable deposits • 

without any agreed maturity which cannot be converted into 

currency without a period of prior notice, before the term of 

which the conversion into cash is not possible or possible only 

with a penalty. They include deposits which, although perhaps 

legally withdrawable on demand, would be subject to penalties 

and restrictions according to national practice, and investment 

accounts without period of notice or agreed maturity, but 

which contain restrictive drawing provisions.

Repos – Counterpart of cash received in exchange for securities/• 

gold sold by reporting agents at a given price under a fi rm 

commitment to repurchase the same (or similar) securities/gold 

at a fi xed price on a specifi ed future date. Amounts received 

by reporting agents in exchange for securities/gold transferred 

to a third party (“temporary acquirer”) are to be classifi ed here 

where there is a fi rm commitment to reverse the operation and 

not merely an option to do so (e.g. repurchase agreements, bond 

lending against cash collateral and sale/buy-back agreement). 

This implies that reporting agents retain effective (economic) 

ownership of the underlying securities/gold during the 

operation. In this respect, the transfer of legal ownership is not 

the relevant feature for determining the treatment of repo-like 

operations. Where the temporary acquirer sells the securities 

received by way of a repo operation, this sale must be recorded 

as an outright transaction in securities/gold and entered in the 

balance sheet of the temporary acquirer as a negative position in 

the securities/gold portfolio.

Money market fund shares/units

Shares/units issued by MMFs. MMFs are CIUs whose shares/units 

are, in terms of liquidity, close substitutes for deposits and which 

primarily invest in money market instruments and/or in MMF 

shares/units and/or in other transferable debt instruments with a 

residual maturity of up to and including one year, and/or in bank 

deposits, and/or which pursue a rate of return that approaches the 

interest rates of money market instruments. (A fuller defi nition is 

contained in Regulation ECB/2011/12.)

N/A•  (MMFs are beyond the scope of FINREP)

Debt securities issued

Securities other than shares (debt securities) issued by reporting 

agents, which are negotiable and usually traded on secondary markets 

or can be offset in the market, and which do not grant the holder any 

ownership rights over the issuing institution. This includes:

Securities that give the holder the unconditional right to a • 

fi xed or contractually determined income in the form of 

coupon payments and/or a stated fi xed sum at a specifi ed date 

(or dates) or starting from a date defi ned at the time of issue;

Non-negotiable (debt) instruments that have subsequently • 

become negotiable should be reclassifi ed  as “debt securities”;

Subordinated debt in the form of debt securities;• 

Convertible bonds, as long as they have not been converted. • 

Where separable from the underlying bond, the conversion 

option should be regarded as a separate fi nancial liability 

(derivative or equity);

“Short selling” should be recorded as a negative position in • 

debt securities (assets) and not as a liability. 

Hybrid instruments, which are combined instruments that • 

contain embedded derivatives that cannot be separated from 

the host contracts (which are negotiable debt securities).

The following items of Table 1.2 should be added: 

“Financial liabilities held for trading – debt securities issued”;• 

“Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profi t or • 

loss – debt securities issued”;

“Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost – debt • 

securities issued”;

Debt securities issued included in “Liabilities included in • 

disposal groups classifi ed as held for sale”. This amount is not 

separately available in FINREP.

The following items of Table 1.2 should be subtracted: 

Debt securities issued that, according to their legal form, are • 

capital but do not meet the IFRS/IAS defi nition of equity 

(e.g. a preferred share that pays a dividend when the entity 

posts profi ts) included in “Financial liabilities measured at 

amortised cost” and “Financial liabilities designated at fair 

value through profi t or loss”. This amount is not separately 

disclosed in FINREP.

BSI requirement FINREP “equivalent”

For the purposes of the BSI reporting scheme, a further 

breakdown is provided for “Of which debt securities up to two 

years and nominal capital guarantee below 100%” – Hybrid 

instruments issued by MFIs of original maturity of up to two years 

and which at maturity may have a contractual redemption value 

in the issuing currency lower than the amount originally invested 

due to their combination of debt and derivative components. 

This redemption value may be linked to the development of an 

underlying reference asset, asset price or other reference indicator 

over the maturity of the instrument. Examples of such instruments 

include, but are not limited to, discount certifi cates and reverse 

convertible securities

Notes: (1) According to IAS 39.42-AG58, when an entity 
repurchases part of a debt security issued, this part shall be 

subtracted from the total amount of debt securities issued (it is not 

recognised as a fi nancial asset) in any case without regarding the 

intention of the issuer (even when it intends to resell it in the near 

term). Similarly, the MFI Guidance Notes state that own holdings 

should be netted out (unless gross recording is required by local 

accounting rules).

(2) In FINREP, embedded derivatives in hybrid instruments are 

separated from the host contracts (IAS 39.11) and recognised 

under items “derivatives held for trading” or “derivatives – hedge 

accounting”. Only hybrid instruments included in the categories 

at fair value through profi t or loss are not segregated from the host 

contracts.

Capital and reserves

This category comprises the amounts arising from the issue 

of equity capital by reporting agents to shareholders or other 

proprietors, representing for the holder property rights in the MFI 

and generally an entitlement to a share in its profi ts and to a share 

in its own funds in the event of liquidation. Funds arising from 

non-distributed benefi ts or funds set aside by reporting agents in 

anticipation of likely future payments and obligations are also 

included. It particularly includes:

Equity capital;• 

Non-distributed benefi ts or funds;• 

Specifi c and general provisions against loans, securities • 

and other types of assets (may be recorded according to the 

accounting rules).

The following items of Table 1.1 should be subtracted: 

 “Fair value changes of the hedged items in portfolio hedge of • 

interest rate risk”. This includes valuation adjustments that are 

recognized in income from the current period or reserves (those 

generated in previous periods).

The following items of Table 1.2 should be added: 

Debt securities that, according to their legal form, are capital • 

but do not meet the IFRS/IAS defi nition of equity (e.g. a 

preferred share that pays a dividend when the entity posts 

profi ts) included in “Financial liabilities measured at amortised 

cost” and “Financial liabilities designated at fair value through 

profi t or loss”. This amount is not separately disclosed in 

FINREP; 

“Fair value changes of the hedged items in portfolio hedge of • 

interest rate risk”. This includes valuation adjustments that are 

recognised in income from the current period or reserves (those 

generated in previous periods);

Part of “Share capital repayable on demand” (if signifi cant • 

penalties apply).

The following items of Table 1.3 should be added: 

“Issued capital”;• 

“Share premium”;• 

“Other equity”;• 

“Revaluation reserves and other valuation differences”;• 

“Reserves”;• 

“Profi t (loss) attributable to equity holders of the parent”. • 

The following items of Table 1.3 should be subtracted: 

“Treasury shares”, i.e. own equity are not recognised as • 

fi nancial assets, but instead deducted from equity;

 “Interim dividends”.• 

Parts of the following items of Table 7 should be added (referring 

to available-for-sale, loans and receivables and held-to-maturity): 

“Loans and advances – Specifi c allowances for individually • 

assessed fi nancial assets” (excluding “Loans and advances” 

that do not meet the ECB defi nition of loans);

“Loans and advances – Specifi c allowances for collectively • 

assessed fi nancial assets” (excluding “Loans and advances” 

that do not meet the ECB defi nition of loans);

“Loans and advances – Allowances for incurred but not • 

reported losses on fi nancial assets” (excluding “Loans and 

advances” that do not meet the ECB defi nition of loans).

The following items of Tables 5.B and 5.C should be added 

(reference to fi nancial assets held for trading and fi nancial assets 

designated at fair value through profi t or loss):

“Loans and advances – Amount of cumulative change in the • 

fair values attributable to changes in credit risk”.

The following amount should be added: 

The difference between the gross carrying amount (i.e. before • 

credit risk allowances) of the loans and the carrying amount 

of the deposits (excluding accrued interest receivable or 

payable) and the principal amount outstanding (i.e. fair value 

measurements, premiums/discounts in the acquisition or 

origination and rest of valuation adjustments should be added).

Notes: 
(1) According to IAS 32.33 and to the MFI Guidance notes, 

when an entity repurchases its own shares, these shares should 

be subtracted from equity (they are not recognised as a fi nancial 

asset).

(2) In FINREP, the amounts of impairment losses for “loans 

and advances” classifi ed as “Available-For-Sale”, “Loan and 

receivables” and “Held-to-maturity investments” are included in 

tables 5.D, 5.E and 7. 

Tables 5.B and 5.C (which refer to “held for trading” and 

“designated at fair value through profi t or loss”) include the 

amount of accumulated losses due to credit risk (a “proxy” for 

impairment losses) for “loans and advances”. The amount of 

accumulated losses due to credit risk related to (potentially) 

impaired “loans and advances” would be equivalent to the 

amount of impairment losses for the total of “loans and advances” 

included in IAS 39 classes at fair value through profi t or loss. 

FINREP does not include information to make a distinction 

between “loans and advances” impaired and not impaired (for 

such classes). 

Information about impairment (or accumulated losses due to 

credit risk) is not separately available for “loans and advances” 

classifi ed as “Non-current assets and disposal groups classifi ed as 

held for sale”.

(3) As for the reconciliation between the principal amount of loans 

and deposits with their carrying amount in IAS/IFRS, Regulation 

ECB/2008/32 establishes that “accrued interest” incomes 

(expenses) are included in “Remaining assets” (“Remaining 

liabilities”) and “impairment losses” in “Capital and reserves”. 

The Regulation does not specify how the other items (fair 

value measurements, premiums/discounts in the acquisition or 

origination, etc.) should be classifi ed in the BSI scheme. For the 

purposes of its classifi cation system, the JEGR assumes that these 

balances are recorded under “Capital and reserves”.

Remaining liabilities

This item is regarded as the residual item on the liability side of 

the balance sheet, defi ned as “liabilities not included elsewhere”. 

It generally includes:

Financial derivative positions with gross negative market • 

values;

Gross amounts payable in respect of suspense and transit items;• 

Accrued interest payable on deposits and liabilities in the form • 

of loans;

Dividends to be paid;• 

Provisions representing liabilities against third parties • 

(pensions, restructuring, etc.);

Net positions arising from securities lending without cash • 

collateral;

Amounts payable not related to the core business.• 

The following items of Table 1.2 should be added: 

“Financial liabilities held for trading – derivatives held for • 

trading”;

 “Financial liabilities held for trading – other fi nancial •

“Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profi t and •

Note: Contingent liabilities (contingencies), i.e. instruments 
which are contingent or conditional on the occurrence of uncertain 

future events, should not be recorded in the balance sheet, but 

instead off-balance sheet. These include, for example, guarantees, 

commitments, administered and trust loans.

Note: Under IAS/IFRS, fi nancial guaranties given and certain 
loan commitments given are recorded on-balance sheet [IAS 
39.47.(c)-(d)]. In FINREP Table 1.2, these fi nancial liabilities 
are included in “other fi nancial liabilities” or, when doubtful, in 
“Provisions – Loan commitments and guaranties”. The treatment 
in BSI statistics, in accordance with ESA95, is to record such 
guarantees and commitments off-balance sheet.

“Liabilities included in disposal groups classifi ed as held for • 

sale”, except deposits and debt securities issued that must 

be classifi ed in the relevant instrument. This amount is not 

separately available in FINREP.

Of which: fi nancial derivatives

Financial derivative instruments that have a market value 

should be subject to on-balance sheet recording. They have 

a market value when they are traded on organised markets 

or in circumstances in which they can be regularly offset on 

non-organised over-the-counter markets. Derivatives should 

be recorded on a gross basis; therefore, derivative contracts 

with gross negative market values should be recorded on the 

liability side. 

Note: Notional amounts should not be entered as on-balance sheet 
items. 

The following items of Table 1.2 should be added: 

“Financial liabilities held for trading – derivatives held for • 

trading”;

“Derivatives – Hedge accounting”;• 

Derivatives included in “Liabilities included in disposal groups • 

classifi ed as held for sale”. This amount is not separately 

available in FINREP.

Of which: accrued interest

Accrued interest expenses on “deposits”, i.e. interest payable 

at the reporting date, but not due to be paid until a future date, 

must be classifi ed on a gross basis under this category. Accrued 

interest is to be excluded from the deposit to which it relates, 

which should be valued at the nominal amount outstanding at 

reporting date.

In FINREP, accrued interest is recorded together with the 

underlying instrument.

1) This column describes the BSI instruments’ coverage and lists the best matching COREP items for the tables on Market Risk – standard 
approach. This exercise is complicated by the differences in the structure of the two reporting schemes. A similar bridging for the advanced 
approaches is not possible. Market risk is calculated on the trading book of credit institutions. The trading book of an institution consists 
of all positions in fi nancial instruments and commodities held either with trading intent or in order to hedge other elements of the trading 
book and which are either free of any restrictive covenants on their tradability or able to be hedged. Positions held with trading intent are 
those held intentionally for short-term resale and/or with the intention of benefi ting from actual or expected short-term price differences 
between buying and selling prices or from other price or interest rate variations. Capital requirements are calculated as a % of the net 
position in a set of instruments. The excess of an institution’s long (short) positions over its short (long) positions in the same equity, debt 
and convertible issues and identical fi nancial futures, options, warrants and covered warrants represents its net position in each of those 
different instruments. In calculating the net position, the competent authorities allow positions in derivative instruments to be treated as 
positions in the underlying securities.

and synthetic securitisations

Only for originators -

Note: In BSI, the fi nancial 
assets are derecognised when 

all risks and rewards of the 

ownership are transferred. 

The reconciliation of BSI 

requirements with this template 

of COREP arises when there 

are loans not derecognised in 

BSI that meet the securitisation 

criteria of the CRD. 

Note: In BSI, Tables 5a) 
and 5b) require data on 

securitisations and other 

loan transfers. The data are 

on outstanding amounts 

of securitised loans not 

derecognised, on outstanding 

amounts of loans serviced in 

securitizations, and on net 

fl ows of loans securitised (or 

otherwise transferred). The link 

between these BSI tables and 

COREP has not been explored.

Loans are only subject to 

capital requirements for 

market risk in terms of foreign 

exchange risk.

If the sum of an institution’s 

overall net foreign exchange 

position and its net gold 

position exceeds 2% of its total 

own funds, it must multiply 

the sum of its net foreign 

exchange position and its net 

gold position by 8% in order 

to calculate its own funds 

requirement against foreign 

exchange risk.

A two-stage calculation must 

be used for capital requirements 

for foreign exchange risk.

Firstly, the institution’s net 

open position in each currency 

(including the reporting 

currency) and in gold is 

calculated. Secondly, net 

short and long positions in 

each currency other than the 

reporting currency and the net 

long or short position in gold are 

converted at spot rates into the 

reporting currency. They must 

then be summed separately to 

form the total of the net short 

positions and the total of the 

net long positions respectively. 

The higher of these two totals 

is the institution’s overall net 

foreign exchange position. 

The competent authorities may 

allow institutions to remove 

positions in any currency which 

is subject to a legally binding 

intergovernmental agreement 

to limit its variation relative to 

other currencies covered by the 

same agreement.

Unmatched positions in those 

currencies must be treated 

in the same way as other 

currencies.

1.3.2. Subordinated claims and 

other items in other credit and 

fi nancial institutions in which 

holdings exceed 10% of their 

capital (for the part referred to 

as loans).

1.3.3. Excess on limit for 

holdings, subordinated claims 

and other items in credit and 

fi nancial institutions in which 

holdings are up to 10% of their 

capital (for the part referred to

General risk: Maturity-based 
approach

The procedure for calculating 

capital requirements against 

general risk involves two 

basic steps. First, all positions 

must be weighted according to 

maturity (residual or interest 

rate reset interval), in order to 

compute the amount of capital 

required against them. 

Second, allowance is made 

for this requirement to be 

reduced when a weighted 

position is held alongside an 

opposite weighted position 

within the same maturity band. 

A reduction in the requirement 

is also allowed when the 

opposite weighted positions fall 

into different maturity bands, 

with the size of this reduction 

depending both on whether 

the two positions fall into the 

same zone (maturity bands are 

grouped into three zones) or 

not, and on the particular zones 

they fall into. 

The institution must assign its 

net positions to the appropriate 

maturity bands. It does so on the 

basis of residual maturity in the 

case of fi xed-rate instruments 

and on the basis of the period 

until the interest rate is next 

set in the case of instruments 

on which the interest rate is 

variable before fi nal maturity. 

Net positions will be weighted 

for the maturity band in 

question.

It then works out the sum of 

the weighted long positions 

and the sum of the weighted 

short positions in each maturity 

band. The amount of the 

former which are matched by 

the latter in a given maturity 

band is the matched weighted

position in that band, while the 

residual long or short position is 

the unmatched weighted position 

for the same band. The total of 

the matched weighted positions 

in all bands is then be calculated. 

General risk: Duration-based 
approach

The competent authorities may 

allow institutions in general or 

on an individual basis to use a 

system for calculating the capital 

requirement for the general risk 

on traded debt instruments 

which refl ects duration.

Specifi c risk 

This risk is calculated on a 

different basis for each issuer 

and therefore it has no link 

with the BSI breakdown by 

counterparties. However, to the 

extent that security-by-security 

(*) reporting arrangements are 

in place, a relatively easy link 

could be established.

Particular approach for 
position risk in CIUs

Positions in CIUs, incl. MMF 

shares/units, are subject to a 

capital requirement for position 

risk (specifi c and general). 

Where the institution is aware 

of the underlying investments of 

the CIU on a daily basis, i.e. if 

the institution can look through 

to those underlying investments 

in order to calculate the capital 

requirements for position risk 

(general and specifi c) for those 

positions. If the look-through is 

not possible, banks pay a fi xed 

capital requirement.

Under this approach, positions 

in CIUs are treated as positions 

in the underlying investments 

of the CIU. Netting is permitted 

between positions in the 

underlying investments of the 

CIU and other positions held 

by the institution.

- N.A. - N.A. The position risk on equity 
(or equity derivative) is divided 

into two components in order 

to calculate the capital required 

against it. The fi rst is its 

specifi c risk component – this 

is the risk of a price change in 

the instrument concerned due 

to factors related to its issuer 

or, in the case of a derivative, 

the issuer of the underlying 

instrument. The second 

component covers its general 

risk –  this is the risk of a price 

change in the instrument due 

(in the case of an equity or 

equity derivative) to a broad 

equity market movement 

unrelated to any specifi c 

attributes of individual 

securities.

The institution must sum all its 

net long positions and all its 

net short positions. The sum 

of the two fi gures is its overall 

gross position. The difference 

between them is its overall net 

position.

Specifi c risk. The institution 
must sum all its net long 

positions and all its net short 

positions. It multiplies its 

overall gross position in order to 

calculate its capital requirement 

against specifi c risk. 

General risk. Its capital 
requirement against general 

risk is its overall net position.

Stock-index futures may be 

broken down into positions 

in each of their constituent 

equities. These positions may be 

treated as underlying positions 

in the equities in question, and 

may, subject to the approval 

of the competent authorities, 

be netted against opposite 

positions in the underlying 

equities themselves.

By derogation, stock-index 

futures which are exchange 

traded and – in the opinion of the 

competent authorities – represent 

broadly diversifi ed indices attract 

a capital requirement against 

general risk of 8%, but no capital 

requirement against specifi c risk.

If a stock-index future is not 

broken down into its underlying 

positions, it must be treated as 

if it were an individual equity.

position risk in CIUs*

Particular approach for 
position risk in CIUs

Positions in CIUs are subject to a 

capital requirement for position 

risk (specifi c and general). 

Where the institution is aware 

of the underlying investments 

of the CIU on a daily basis, the 

institution may look through to 

those underlying investments 

in order to calculate the capital 

requirements for position risk 

(general and specifi c) for those 

positions.

Under this approach, positions 

in CIUs are treated as positions 

in the underlying investments 

of the CIU. Netting is permitted 

between positions in the 

underlying investments of the 

CIU and other positions held 

by the institution.

N.A.  - Each position in commodities 
or commodity derivatives 
must be expressed in terms 

of the standard unit of 

measurement. The spot price 

in each commodity must be 

expressed in the reporting 

currency. Positions in gold 

or gold derivatives are 

considered as being subject 

to foreign exchange risk. The 

excess of an institution’s long 

(short) positions over its short 

(long) positions in the same 

commodity and identical 

commodity futures, options 

and warrants is its net position 

in each commodity. Options on 

commodities or on commodity 

derivatives are treated as if they 

were positions equal in value to 

the amount of the underlying 

to which the option refers. The 

latter positions may be netted 

off against any offsetting 

positions in the identical 

underlying commodity or 

commodity derivative.

Detailed information 

(CR SEC Details)

Competent authorities may 

allow positions in the same 

commodity to be offset and 

assigned to the appropriate 

maturity bands on a net basis 

for the following: positions in 

contracts maturing on the same 

date; and positions in contracts 

maturing within 10 days of each 

other if the contracts are traded 

on markets which have daily 

delivery dates. The institution 

then calculates the sum of the 

long positions and the sum 

of the short positions in each 

maturity band. The amount of 

the former (latter) which are 

matched by the latter (former) 

in a given maturity band are 

the matched positions in that 

band, while the residual long or 

short position is the unmatched 

position for the same band.

Simplifi ed approach

The institution’s capital 

requirement for each commodity 

can be calculated as the sum of:

15% of the net position, long 

or short, multiplied by the spot 

price for the commodity; 

3% of the gross position, long 

plus short, multiplied by the 

spot price for the commodity.

Extended Maturity ladder 
approach

Competent authorities may 

authorise institutions to use the 

minimum spread when they:

undertake signifi cant • 

commodities business;

have a diversifi ed • 

commodities portfolio.

In addition to the 
above-mentioned capital 
requirements regarding the 
position risk, the positions 
in commodities and fi nancial 
derivatives are subject to two 
further capital requirements:

Amounts owed to creditors by 

reporting agents, other than 

those arising from the issue 

of negotiable securities. This 

category also covers loans as 

liabilities of MFIs. 

Non-negotiable debt 

instruments issued by reporting 

agents are generally to be 

classifi ed in this category. 

Instruments may be referred 

to as being “non-negotiable” 

in the sense that there are 

restrictions on the transfer 

of legal ownership of the 

instrument, which means that 

they cannot be marketed or, 

although technically negotiable, 

they cannot be traded owing to 

the absence of an organised 

market. Non-negotiable 

instruments issued by reporting 

agents that subsequently 

become negotiable and that can 

be traded on secondary markets 

should be reclassifi ed in the 

category “debt securities”; 

syndicated loans received by 

MFIs fall into this category.

This category includes 

subordinated debt issued by the 

entity in the form of deposits 

or loans.

6 ASSESSMENT OF THE LINKS BETWEEN BSI REQUIREMENTS WITH COREP EQUIVALENT 

(OPERATIONAL RISK)

According to Basel 2, operational risk is a signifi cant risk faced by credit institutions requiring 

coverage by own funds. It means the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 

processes, people and systems or from external events, and includes legal risk. There are three 

alternative approaches to the calculation of operational risk requirements incorporating different 

levels of risk-sensitivity and requiring different degrees of sophistication. The table below provides 

an assessment of the link with BSI statistics for each of these three approaches. In all cases, the 

(provisional) conclusion is that there are no direct links between the two frameworks.

BSI COREP
Operational risk

Basic Indicator Approach Standardised Approach Advanced Measurement Approaches

The capital requirement for operational 

risk under the Basic Indicator Approach 

is equal to 15% of the relevant 

indicator.

The relevant indicator is the average 

over three years of the sum of net 

interest income and net non-interest 

income.

The three-year average is calculated 

on the basis of the last three twelve-

monthly observations at the end of the 

fi nancial year. When audited fi gures 

are not available, business estimates 

may be used.

Based on the accounting categories 

for the profi t and loss account of 

credit institutions under Article 27 of 

Directive 86/635/EEC, the relevant 

indicator is to be expressed as the sum 

of the elements listed below. Each 

element must be included in the sum 

with its positive or negative sign.

Interest receivable and similar 1. 
income.

Interest payable and similar 2. 
charges. 

Income from shares and other 3. 
variable/fi xed-yield securities.

Commissions/fees receivable.4. 

Commissions/fees payable.5. 

Net profi t or net loss on fi nancial 6. 
operations.

Other operating income.7. 

Under the Standardised Approach, 

credit institutions divide their activities 

into a number of business lines.

Business line are: 

1. Corporate fi nance

2. Trading and sales

3. Retail brokerage

4. Commercial banking

5. Retail banking

6. Payment and settlement

7. Agency services

8. Asset management

9. Corporate items

For each business line, credit 

institutions must calculate a capital 

requirement for operational risk as 

a certain percentage of a relevant 

indicator, expressed in terms of Gross 

Income. (Table 2 Consolidated Income 

Statement – continuing operations).

The capital requirement for operational 

risk under the Standardised Approach 

is the sum of the capital requirements 

for operational risk across all individual 

business lines.

All activities must be mapped into the 

business lines in a mutually exclusive 

and jointly exhaustive manner.

Credit institutions must have a 

well-documented assessment and 

management system for operational 

risk with clear responsibilities assigned 

for this system. They must identify 

their exposures to operational risk and 

track relevant operational risk data, 

including material loss data.

Credit institutions may use Advanced 

Measurement Approaches based on 

their own operational risk measurement 

systems, provided that the competent 

authority expressly approves the use of 

the models concerned for calculating 

the own funds requirement. In practice 

this may occur very rarely.

In order to get approval, credit 

institutions must have in place regular 

reporting procedures of operational 

risk exposures and loss experience.

Credit institutions calculate their 

capital requirement as comprising 

both expected loss and unexpected 

loss, unless they can demonstrate that 

expected loss is adequately captured in 

their internal business practices.

The operational risk measurement 

system of a credit institution must have 

certain key elements.

These elements must include the use 

of 1) internal data, 2) external data, 

3) scenario analysis and 4) factors 

refl ecting the business environment 

and internal control systems.

A credit institution needs to have a well 

documented approach for weighting 

the use of these four elements in its 

overall operational risk measurement 

system. External data (2nd factor), 

i.e. operational risk data produced by 

other credit institutions, are hardly 

comparable – for this reason, a bank 

should use scaling techniques in 

order to adapt its own data frequency 

distribution with the external data.

BSI COREP
Operational risk

Basic Indicator Approach Standardised Approach Advanced Measurement Approaches

Correlations in operational risk losses 

across individual operational risk 

estimates may be recognised only if 

credit institutions can demonstrate 

to the satisfaction of the competent 

authorities that their systems for 

measuring correlations are sound, 

implemented with integrity, and 

take into account the uncertainty 

surrounding any such correlation 

estimates, particularly in periods of 

stress. The credit institution must 

validate its correlation assumptions 

using appropriate quantitative and 

qualitative techniques.

Credit institutions must be able to 

recognise the impact of insurance and 

other risk transfer mechanisms where 

the credit institution can demonstrate 

to the satisfaction of the competent 

authorities that a noticeable risk-

mitigating effect is achieved.

Conclusions

The item included in the COREP 

template regarding the operational risk 

for the basic approach does not have 

corresponding items in BSI reporting.

Not applicable

The items included in the COREP 

template regarding the operational 

risk for the standardised approach 

(breakdown by business line) do not 

have corresponding items in BSI 

reporting (breakdown by instruments). 

N.B.: Since business lines refer to 
items of the income statement (rather 

than to balance sheet items), there is 

no possibility for a reconciliation of 

certain business lines with BSI items. 

Not applicable

The item included in the COREP 

template regarding the operational 

risk for the advanced approaches does 

not have corresponding items in BSI 

reporting.
