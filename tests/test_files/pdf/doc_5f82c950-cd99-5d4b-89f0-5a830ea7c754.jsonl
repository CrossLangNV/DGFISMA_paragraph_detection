Compliance and reporting obligations \n\nStatus of these Guidelines  \n\n1. This document contains Guidelines issued pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/20101. \nIn accordance with Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, competent authorities and \nfinancial institutions must make every effort to comply with the Guidelines.   \n\n2. Guidelines set the EBA view of appropriate supervisory practices within the European System of \nFinancial Supervision or of how Union law should be applied in a particular area.  Competent \nauthorities as defined in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to whom Guidelines apply \nshould comply by incorporating them into their practices as appropriate (e.g. by amending their \nlegal framework or their supervisory processes), including where Guidelines are directed primarily at \ninstitutions. \n\nReporting requirements \n\n3. According to Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, competent authorities must notify the \nEBA as to whether they comply or intend to comply with these Guidelines, or otherwise with \nreasons for non-compliance, by 13.11.2017 In the absence of any notification by this deadline, \ncompetent authorities will be considered by the EBA to be non-compliant. Notifications should be \nsent by submitting the form available on the EBA website to compliance@eba.europa.eu with the \nreference ‘Eba/gl/2017/05. Notifications should be submitted by persons with appropriate authority \nto report compliance on behalf of their competent authorities.  Any change in the status of \ncompliance must also be reported to EBA.  \n\n4. Notifications will be published on the EBA website, in line with Article 16(3). \n\n                                                            \n1 Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European \nSupervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision \n2009/78/EC, (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p.12). \n\nmailto:compliance@eba.europa.eu\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n3 \n \n\n2. Subject matter, scope and definitions \n\nSubject matter and scope of application \n\n5. These Guidelines, drawn up pursuant to Article 107(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU2 aim to ensure the \nconvergence of supervisory practices in the assessment of the information and communication \ntechnology (ICT) risk under the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) referred to in \nArticle 97 of Directive 2013/36/EU and further specified in the EBA Guidelines on common \nprocedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP)3. In \nparticular these Guidelines specify the assessment criteria that competent authorities should apply \nin the supervisory assessment of institutions’ governance and strategy on ICT and the supervisory \nassessment of institutions’ ICT risk exposures and controls. These Guidelines form an integral part of \nthe EBA SREP Guidelines. \n\n6. Competent authorities should apply these Guidelines in line with the level of application of SREP \nspecified in the EBA SREP Guidelines and in accordance with the minimum engagement model and \nproportionality requirements established therein. \n\nAddressees \n\n7. These Guidelines are addressed to competent authorities as defined in point (i) of Article 4(2) of \nRegulation (EU) No 1093/2010.    \n\nDefinitions \n\n8. Unless otherwise specified, terms used and defined in Directive 2013/36/EU, Regulation (EU) No \n575/2013 and definitions from the EBA SREP Guidelines have the same meaning in these Guidelines. \nIn addition, for the purposes of these Guidelines, the following definitions apply:  \n\n \n\nICT systems ICT set-up as part of a mechanism or an interconnecting \nnetwork that support the operations of an institution. \n\nICT services  Services provided by ICT systems to one or more internal or \nexternal users.

These Guidelines apply from 1 January 2018. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n6 \n \n\n4. Requirements for the ICT Risk \nAssessment  \n\nTitle 1 - General provisions \n10. Competent authorities should perform the assessment of ICT risk and the governance arrangement and \n\nICT strategy as part of the SREP process following the minimum engagement model and proportionality \ncriteria specified in Title 2 of the EBA SREP Guidelines. In particular,  this means that: \n\na. the frequency of the ICT risk assessment would depend on the minimum engagement model \ndriven by the SREP category an institution is assigned to and its specific supervisory \nexamination programme; and  \n\nb. the depth, detail and intensity of ICT assessment should be proportionate to the size, structure \nand operational environment of the institution as well as the nature, scale and complexity of its \nactivities. \n\n11. The principle of proportionality applies throughout these Guidelines to the scope, frequency and \nintensity of supervisory engagement and dialogue with an institution and supervisory expectations of \nthe standards the institution should meet.  \n\n12. Competent authorities may rely on and take into consideration work already undertaken by the \ninstitution or by the competent authority in the context of the assessments of other risks or SREP \nelements in order to have an update of the assessment. Specifically, in conducting the assessments \nspecified in these Guidelines competent authorities should select the most appropriate supervisory \nassessment approach and methodology that is best suited and proportionate to the institution and \ncompetent authorities should use existing and available documentation (e.g. relevant reports and other \ndocuments, meetings with (risk) management, on-site inspection findings) to inform the competent \nauthorities’ assessment. \n\n13. Competent authorities should summarise the findings of their assessments of the criteria specified in \nthese Guidelines and use them for the purposes of reaching conclusions on the assessment of the SREP \nelements as specified in the EBA SREP Guidelines.  \n\n14. In particular, the assessment of governance and ICT strategy performed in accordance with Title 2 of \nthese Guidelines should result in findings that inform the summary of findings of the assessment of \ninternal governance and institution-wide controls element of SREP as specified in Title 5 of the EBA SREP \nGuidelines and be reflected the respective scoring of that SREP element. Furthermore, competent \nauthorities should consider that any significant adverse impact of the ICT strategy assessment on the \ninstitution’s business strategy or any concerns that the institution may not have sufficient ICT resources \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n7 \n \n\nand ICT capabilities to perform and support important planned strategic changes should inform the \nbusiness model analysis performed in accordance with Title 4 of the EBA SREP Guidelines. \n\n15. The outcome of the assessment of ICT risk as specified in Title 3 of these Guidelines should inform the \nfindings of the assessment of operational risk and should be considered as informing the relevant score \nas specified in in Title 6.4 of the EBA SREP Guidelines.  \n\n16. It is noted that whilst generally competent authorities should assess sub-categories of risks as part of \nthe main categories (i.e. ICT risk will be assessed as part of operational risk), where competent \nauthorities deem some sub-categories material, they may assess such sub-categories on an individual \nbasis. To this end, should ICT risk be identified as a material risk by the competent authority, these \nGuidelines also provide a scoring table (Table 1) that should be used to provide a stand-alone sub-\ncategory score for ICT risk following the overall approach to scoring the risks to capital in the EBA SREP \nGuidelines. \n\n17. To reach a view on whether ICT risk should be considered as material and therefore the possibility for \nICT risk to be assessed and scored as an individual sub-category of operational risk, competent \nauthorities may use the criteria specified in Section 6.1 of the EBA SREP Guidelines. \n\n18. When applying these Guidelines competent authorities should, where relevant, consider the non-\nexhaustive list of ICT risk sub-categories and risk scenarios as set out in the Annex, noting that the Annex \nfocusses on ICT risks that may result in high severity losses. Competent authorities may exclude some of \nthe ICT risks included in the taxonomy if not pertinent to their assessment. Institutions are expected to \nmaintain their own risk taxonomies rather than using the ICT risk taxonomy set out in the Annex. \n\n19. Where these Guidelines are applied in relation to cross-border banking groups and their entities, and a \ncollege of supervisors has been established, competent authorities involved should, in the context of \ntheir cooperation for the SREP assessment in accordance with Section 11.1 of the EBA SREP Guidelines, \ncoordinate to the maximum extent possible the exact and detailed scope of each information item \nconsistently for all group entities.  \n\n \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n8 \n \n\nTitle 2 - Assessment of institutions’ \ngovernance and strategy on ICT \n2.1 General principles  \n\n20. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution’s general governance and internal control \nframework duly cover the ICT systems and related risks and if the management body adequately \naddresses and manages these aspects, as ICT is integral to the proper functioning of an institution. \n\n21. In conducting this assessment, competent authorities should refer to the requirements and standards of \ngood internal governance and risk control arrangements as specified in the EBA Guidelines on Internal \nGovernance (GL 44)4 and international guidance in this field to the extent these are applicable given the \nspecificity of ICT systems and risks.  \n\n22. The assessment in this Title does not cover the specific elements of the ICT system governance, risk \nmanagement and controls that are focused on managing specific ICT risks addressed under Title 3 of \nthese Guidelines, but focuses on the following areas: \n\na. ICT strategy - whether the institution has an ICT strategy that is adequately governed and is in \nline with the institution’s business strategy; \n\nb. overall internal governance– whether the institution’s overall internal governance \narrangements are adequate in relation to the institution’s ICT systems; and \n\nc. ICT risk in the institution’s Risk management framework –whether the institution’s risk \nmanagement and internal control framework adequately safeguards the institution’s ICT \nsystems. \n\n23. Point a) referred to in paragraph 22, while providing information about elements of the institution’s \ngovernance, should mainly feed into the assessment of the business model addressed under Title 4 of \nthe EBA SREP Guidelines. Points b) and c) further complement assessments of topics covered by Title 5 \nof the EBA SREP Guidelines and the assessment described in these Guidelines should feed into the \nrespective assessment under Title 5 of the EBA SREP Guidelines.  \n\n24. The outcome of this assessment should inform, where relevant, the assessment of risk management and \ncontrols in Title 3 of these Guidelines. \n\n2.2 ICT strategy \n\n25. Under this section competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an ICT strategy in \nplace: that is subject to adequate oversight from the institution’s management body; that is consistent \n\n                                                            \n4 EBA Guidelines on Internal Governance, GL 44, 27 September 2011. \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n9 \n \n\nwith the business strategy, particularly for keeping its ICT up-to-date and planning or implementing \nimportant and complex ICT changes; and that supports the institution’s business model.  \n\n2.2.1 ICT strategy development and adequacy \n\n26. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has a framework in place, proportionate to \nthe nature, scale and complexity of its ICT activities, for the preparation and development of the \ninstitution’s ICT strategy. In conducting this assessment competent authorities should take into account \nwhether: \n\na. the senior management5 of the business line(s) is adequately involved in the definition of the \ninstitution’s strategic ICT priorities and that, in turn, senior management of the ICT function \nis aware of the development, design and initiation of major business strategies and initiatives \nto ensure the continued alignment between ICT systems, ICT services and the ICT function \n(i.e. those responsible for the management and deployment of these systems and services), \nand the institution’s business strategy, and that ICT are effectively up-dated; \n\nb. the ICT strategy is documented and supported by concrete implementation plans, in \nparticular regarding the important milestones and resource planning  (including financial and \nhuman resources) to ensure that they are realistic and enable the delivery of the ICT \nstrategy; \n\nc. the institution periodically updates its ICT strategy, in particular when changing the business \nstrategy, to ensure continued alignment between the ICT and business medium-term to long-\nterm objectives, plans and activities; and  \n\nd. the institution’s management body approves the ICT strategy, implementation plans and \nmonitors its implementation. \n\n2.2.2 ICT strategy implementation \n\n27. If the institution’s ICT strategy requires the implementation of important and complex ICT changes, or \nchanges with material implications for the institution’s business model, competent authorities should \nassess whether the institution has a control framework in place, appropriate to its size, its ICT activities \nas well as the level of change activities, to support the effective implementation of the institution’s ICT \nstrategy. In conducting this assessment competent authorities should take into account whether the \ncontrol framework: \n\na. includes governance processes (e.g. progress and budget monitoring and reporting) and \nrelevant bodies (e.g. a project management office (PMO), an ICT steering group or \nequivalent) to effectively support the implementation of the ICT strategic programmes;  \n\nb. has defined and allocated the roles and responsibilities for the implementation of ICT \nstrategic programmes, paying particular attention to the experience of key stakeholders in \norganising, steering and monitoring important and complex ICT changes and the \n\n                                                            \n5 Senior management and management body as defined in the Directive 2013/36/EU of 26 June 2013 in Article 3 (7) \n‘management body’, and Article 3 (9) ‘senior management’. \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n10 \n \n\nmanagement of the wider organisational and human impacts (e.g. managing resistance to \nchange, training, communication). \n\nc. engages the independent control and internal audit functions to provide assurance that the \nrisks associated with ICT strategy implementation have been identified, assessed and \neffectively mitigated and that the governance framework in place to implement the ICT \nstrategy is effective; and \n\nd. contains a planning and planning review process that provides flexibility to respond to \nimportant identified issues (e.g. encountered implementation problems or delays) or \nexternal developments (e.g. important changes in the business environment, technological \nissues or innovations) to ensure a timely adaptation of the strategic implementation plan.   \n\n2.3 Overall internal governance  \n\n28. In accordance with Title 5 of the EBA SREP Guidelines, competent authorities should assess whether the \ninstitution has an appropriate and transparent corporate structure that is ‘fit for purpose’, and has \nimplemented appropriate governance arrangements. With specific regard to ICT systems and in line \nwith the EBA Guidelines on internal governance, this assessment should include an assessment of \nwhether the institution demonstrates: \n\na. a robust and transparent organisational structure with clear responsibilities on ICT, including \nthe management body and its committees and that key responsible persons for ICT (e.g. chief \ninformation officer ‘CIO’, chief operating officer ‘COO’ or equivalent role) have adequate \nindirect or direct access to the management body, to ensure that important ICT-related \ninformation or issues are adequately reported, discussed and decided upon at the level of the \nmanagement body; and \n\nb. that the management body knows and addresses the risks associated with the ICT; \n\n29. Further to section 5.2 of the EBA SREP Guidelines, competent authorities should assess whether the \ninstitution’s ICT outsourcing policy and strategy considers, where relevant, the impact of ICT outsourcing \non the institution’s business and business model. \n\n2.4 ICT risk in the institution’s risk management framework \n\n30. In assessing the institution’s institution-wide risk management and internal controls, as provided by Title \n5 of the EBA SREP Guidelines, competent authorities should consider whether the institution’s risk \nmanagement and internal control framework adequately safeguards the institution’s ICT systems in a \nway which is commensurate to the size and activities of the institution and its ICT risk profile as defined \nin Title 3. In particular, competent authorities should determine whether: \n\na. the risk appetite and the ICAAP cover the ICT risks, as part of the broader operational risk \ncategory, for the definition of the overall risk strategy and determination of internal capital; \nand \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n11 \n \n\nb. the ICT risks are within the scope of institution-wide risk management and internal control \nframeworks. \n\n31. Competent authorities should conduct the assessment under point (a) above having regard to both \nexpected and adverse scenarios, e.g. scenarios included in the institution-specific or supervisory stress \ntest.  \n\n32. With specific regard to b), competent authorities should assess whether the independent control and \ninternal audit functions, as detailed in paragraphs 104 (a), 104 (d), 105 (a) and 105 (c) of the EBA SREP \nGuidelines, are appropriate to ensure a sufficient level of independence between the ICT and the \ncontrol and audit functions, given the size and ICT risk profile of the institution.  \n\n2.5 Summary of findings  \n\n33. These results should be reflected in the summary of findings under Title 5 of the EBA SREP Guidelines \nand should form part of the respective scoring in line with the considerations in Table 3 of the EBA SREP \nGuidelines. \n\n34. For the assessment of ICT strategy, the following points should be considered in concluding the above \nassessment: \n\na. if competent authorities come to the conclusion that the institution’s governance framework is \ninadequate for developing and implementing the institution’s ICT strategy under 2.2 then this \nshould inform the assessment of the institution’s internal governance in Title 5 of the EBA SREP \nGuidelines under point 87 (a);  \n\nb. if competent authorities come to the conclusion from the above assessments under 2.2 that \nthere would be a significant misalignment between the ICT strategy and the business strategy \nthat may have a significant adverse impact of the institution’s long term business and/or \nfinancial objectives, the institution’s sustainability and/or business model, or the institution’s \nbusiness areas/lines which have been determined as most material in paragraph 62 (a) of the \nEBA SREP Guidelines, then this should inform the business model assessment of Title 4 of the \nSREP GL under points 70 (b) and 70 (c); and \n\nc. if competent authorities come to the conclusion from the above assessments under 2.2  that \nthe institution may not have sufficient ICT resources and ICT implementation capabilities to \nperform and support important planned strategic changes this should inform the business \nmodel assessment of Title 4 of the EBA SREP Guidelines under point 70 (b).  \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n12 \n \n\nTitle 3 - Assessment of institutions’ ICT risks \nexposures and controls \n3.1 General considerations \n\n35. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has properly identified, assessed and \nmitigated its ICT risks. This process should be part of the operational risk management framework and \ncongruent to the approach applying to operational risk.  \n\n36. Competent authorities should first identify the material inherent ICT risks to which the institution is or \nmight be exposed, followed by an assessment of the effectiveness of the institution’s ICT risks’ \nmanagement framework, procedures and controls to mitigate these risks. The outcome of the \nassessment should be reflected in a summary of findings which feeds into the operational risk score in \nthe SREP Guidelines. Where ICT risk is deemed to be material and competent authorities want to assign \nan individual score then Table 1 should be used to assign a score as a sub-risk of operational risk. \n\n37. When performing the assessment under this Title, competent authorities should use all available \ninformation sources as set out in paragraph 127 of Title 6 of the EBA SREP Guidelines e.g. institution’s \nrisk management activities, reporting and outcomes, as a basis for the identification of their supervisory \nassessment priorities. Competent authorities should also use other sources of information to conduct \nthis assessment, including the following where relevant: \n\na. ICT risk and controls self-assessments (if provided in the ICAAP information); \nb. ICT risk related Management Information (MI) submitted to the institution’s management \n\nbody, e.g. periodic and incident driven ICT risk reporting (including in the operational loss \ndatabase), ICT risk exposure data from the institution’s risk management function; \n\nc. ICT related internal and external audit findings reported to the institution’s audit committee. \n \n\n3.2 Identification of material ICT risks \n\n38. Competent authorities should identify the material ICT risks to which the institution is or might be \nexposed following the steps below.  \n\n3.2.1 Review of the institution’s ICT risk profile  \n\n39. When reviewing the institution’s ICT risk profile, competent authorities should consider all relevant \ninformation about the institution’s ICT risk exposures, including the information under paragraph 37 and \nthe identified material deficiencies or weaknesses in the ICT organisation and institution –wide controls \nunder Title 2 of these Guidelines, and where relevant review this information in a proportionate \nmanner.  As part of this review, competent authorities should consider: \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n13 \n \n\na. the potential impact of a significant disruption on the institution’s ICT systems on the \nfinancial system either at domestic or international level; \n\nb. whether the institution may be subject to ICT security risks or ICT availability and continuity \nrisks due to internet dependencies, high adoption of innovative ICT solutions or other \nbusiness distribution channels that may make it a more likely target for cyber-attacks;   \n\nc. whether the institution may be more exposed to ICT security risks, ICT availability and \ncontinuity risks, ICT data integrity risks or ICT change risks due to the complexity (e.g. as a \nresult of mergers or acquisitions) or outdated nature of its ICT systems; \n\nd. whether the institution is implementing material changes to its ICT systems and/or ICT \nfunction (e.g. as a result of mergers, acquisitions, divestments or the replacement of its core \nICT systems), which may adversely impact the stability or orderly functioning of the ICT \nsystems and can result in material ICT availability and continuity risks, ICT security risks, ICT \nchange risks or ICT data integrity risks; \n\ne. whether the institution has outsourced ICT services or ICT systems within or outside the \ngroup that may expose it to material ICT outsourcing risks;  \n\nf. whether the institution is implementing aggressive ICT cost cutting measures which may lead \nto the reduction of needed ICT investments, resources and IT expertise and can increase the \nexposure to all the ICT risks types in the taxonomy; \n\ng. whether the location of important ICT operations/data centres (e.g. regions, countries) may \nexpose the institution to natural disasters (e.g. flooding, earthquakes), political instability or \nlabour conflicts and civil disturbances which can lead to a material increase of ICT availability \nand continuity risks and ICT security risks.  \n\n3.2.2 Review of the critical ICT systems and services  \n\n40. As part of the process to identify the ICT risks with a potential significant prudential impact on the \ninstitution, competent authorities should review documentation from the institution and form an \nopinion on which ICT systems and services are critical for the adequate functioning, availability, \ncontinuity and security of the institution’s essential activities. \n\n41. To this end, competent authorities should review the methodology and processes applied by the \ninstitution to identify the ICT systems and services that are critical, taking into consideration that some \nICT systems and services may be considered critical by the institution from a business continuity and \navailability perspective, a security (e.g. fraud prevention) and/or a confidentiality perspective (e.g. \nconfidential data). When performing the review, competent authorities should conduct their review \ntaking into consideration that critical ICT systems and services should fulfil at least one of the following \nconditions:   \n\na. they support the core business operations and distribution channels (e.g. ATMs, internet and \nmobile banking) of the institution;  \n\nb. they support essential governance processes and corporate functions, including risk \nmanagement (e.g. risk management and treasury management systems); \n\nc. they fall under special legal or regulatory requirements (if any) that impose heightened  \navailability, resilience, confidentiality or security requirements (e.g. data protection legislation \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n14 \n \n\nor possible ‘Recovery Time Objectives’ (RTO, the maximum time within which a system or \nprocess must be restored after an incident) and ‘Recovery Point Objective’ (RPO, the maximum \ntime period during which data can be lost in case of an incident)) for some systemically \nimportant services (if and where applicable)); \n\nd. they process or store confidential or sensitive data to which unauthorised access could \nsignificantly impact the institution’s reputation, financial results or the soundness and \ncontinuity of its business (e.g. databases with sensitive customer data); and/or \n\ne. they provide base line functionalities that are vital for the adequate functioning of the \ninstitution (e.g. telecom and connectivity services, ICT and cyber security services). \n\n3.2.3 Identification of material ICT risks to critical ICT Systems and Services \n\n42. Taking into account the performed reviews of the institution’s ICT risk profile and critical ICT systems \nand services above, competent authorities should form an opinion on the material ICT risks that, in their \nsupervisory judgement, can have a significant prudential impact on the institution’s critical ICT systems \nand services.  \n\n43. When assessing the potential impact of ICT risks on the critical ICT systems and services of an institution, \ncompetent authorities should consider: \n\na. The financial impact, including (but not limited to) loss of funds or assets, potential customer \ncompensation, legal and remediation costs, contractual damages, lost revenue; \n\nb. The potential for business disruption, considering (but not limited to) the criticality of the financial \nservices affected; the number of customers and/or branches and employees potentially affected; \n\nc. The potential reputational impact on the institution based on the criticality of the banking service \nor operational activity affected (e.g. theft of customer data); the external profile/visibility of the ICT \nsystems and services affected (e.g. mobile or on-line banking systems, point of sale, ATMs or \npayment systems); \n\nd. The regulatory impact, including the potential for public censure by the regulator, fines or even \nvariation of permissions.  \n\ne. The strategic impact on the institution, for example if strategic product or business plans are \ncompromised or stolen. \n\n44. Competent authorities should then map the identified ICT risks that are considered material into the \nfollowing ICT risk categories for which additional risk descriptions and examples are provided in the \nAnnex. Competent authorities should reflect on the ICT risks in the Annex as part of the assessment \nunder Title 3: \n\na. ICT availability and continuity risk \nb. ICT security risk \nc. ICT change risk \nd. ICT data integrity risk \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n15 \n \n\ne. ICT outsourcing risk \n\nThe mapping is to assist competent authorities in determining which risks are material (if any) and \ntherefore should be subject to a closer and/or deeper review in the following assessment steps. \n\n3.3 Assessment of the controls to mitigate material ICT risks  \n\n45. To assess the institution’s residual ICT risk exposure, competent authorities should review how the \ninstitution identifies, monitors, assesses and mitigates the material risks identified by the competent \nauthorities in the assessment above.  \n\n46. To this end, for the identified material ICT risks, competent authorities should review the applicable: \n\na. ICT risk management policy, processes and risk tolerance thresholds;  \n\nb. Organisational management and oversight framework;  \n\nc. Internal audit coverage and findings; and \n\nd. ICT risk controls that are specific for the identified material ICT risk. \n\n47. The assessment should take into account the outcome of the analysis of the overall risk management \nand internal control framework as referred to in Title 5 of the EBA SREP Guidelines, as well as the \ninstitution’s governance and strategy addressed in Title 2 of these Guidelines, as significant deficiencies \nidentified in these areas may influence the ability of the institution to manage and mitigate its ICT risk \nexposures. Where relevant, competent authorities should also make use of information sources in \nparagraph 37 of these Guidelines. \n\n48. Competent authorities should perform the following assessment steps in a manner that is proportionate \nto the nature, scale and complexity of the institution’s activities and by applying a supervisory review \nthat is appropriate to the institution’s ICT risk profile. \n\n3.3.1 ICT risk management policy, processes and tolerance thresholds \n\n49. Competent authorities should review whether the institution has appropriate risk management policies, \nprocesses and tolerance thresholds in place for the identified material ICT risks. These can be a part of \nthe operational risk management framework or a separate document. For this assessment competent \nauthorities should take into account whether:  \n\na. the risk management policy is formalised and approved by the management body and \ncontains sufficient guidance on the institution’s ICT risk appetite, and on the main pursued \nICT risk management objectives and/or applied ICT risk tolerance thresholds. The relevant \nICT risk management policy should also be communicated to all relevant stakeholders; \n\nb. the applicable policy covers all significant elements for the risk management of the \nidentified material ICT risks; \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n16 \n \n\nc. the institution has implemented a process and underlying procedures for the identification \n(e.g. ‘risk control self-assessments’ (RCSA), risk scenario analysis) and monitoring of the \ninvolved material ICT risks;  and \n\nd. the institution has an ICT risk management reporting in place that provides timely \ninformation to senior management and the management body, and which allows senior \nmanagement and/or the management body to assess and monitor whether the \ninstitution´s ICT risk mitigation plans and measures are consistent with the approved risk \nappetite and/or tolerance thresholds (where relevant) and to monitor changes of material \nICT risks. \n\n3.3.2 Organisational management and oversight framework \n\n50. Competent authorities should assess how the applicable risk management roles and responsibilities are \nembedded and integrated in the internal organisation to manage and oversee the identified material ICT \nrisks. In this regard competent authorities should assess whether the institution demonstrates: \n\na. clear roles and responsibilities for the identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation, \nreporting and oversight of the involved material ICT risk; \n\nb. that the risk responsibilities and roles are clearly communicated, allocated and embedded \nin all relevant parts (e.g. business lines, IT) and processes of the organisation, including the \nroles and responsibilities for gathering and aggregating the risk information and reporting it \nto senior management and/or the management body; \n\nc. that the ICT risk management activities are performed with sufficient and qualitatively \nappropriate human and technical resources.  To assess the credibility of the applicable risk \nmitigation plans, competent authorities should also assess whether the institution has \nallocated sufficient financial budgets and/or other required resources for their \nimplementation; \n\nd. an adequate follow-up and response of the management body regarding important findings \nfrom the independent control functions regarding the ICT risk(s), taking into account the \npossible delegation of some aspects to a committee, where this exists; and \n\ne. that exceptions from applicable ICT regulations and policies are recorded and subject to a \ndocumented review and reporting by the independent control function with a focus on the \nrelated risks. \n\n3.3.3 Internal audit coverage and findings  \n\n51. Competent authorities should consider whether the Internal Audit Function is effective with regards to \nauditing the applicable ICT risk control framework, by reviewing whether: \n\na. the ICT risk control framework is audited with the required quality, depth and frequency \nand  commensurate with the size, activities and the ICT risk profile of the institution; \n\nb. the audit plan includes audits on the critical ICT risks identified by the institution; \n\nc. the  important ICT audit findings, including agreed actions, are reported to the \nmanagement body; and \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n17 \n \n\nd. ICT audit findings, including agreed actions, are followed up and progress reports \nperiodically reviewed by the senior management and/or the audit committee. \n\n3.3.4 ICT risk controls that are specific for the identified material ICT risks  \n\n52. For the identified material ICT risks, competent authorities should assess whether the institution has \nspecific controls in place to address these risks. The following sections provide a non-exhaustive list of \nthe specific controls to be considered when assessing the material risks identified under point 3.2.3 that \nwere mapped to the following ICT risk categories:    \n\na. ICT availability and continuity risks; \nb. ICT security risks; \nc. ICT change risks; \nd. ICT data integrity risks; \ne. ICT outsourcing risks.  \n\n(a) Controls for managing material ICT availability and continuity risks \n\n53. In addition to the requirements in the EBA SREP Guidelines (para 279 - 281) competent authorities \nshould assess whether the institution has an appropriate framework in place for identifying, \nunderstanding, measuring and mitigating ICT availability and continuity risks.  \n\n54. For this assessment, competent authorities should, in particular, take into account whether the \nframework: \n\na. identifies the critical ICT processes and the relevant supporting ICT systems that should be part of \nthe business resilience and continuity plans with: \n\ni. a comprehensive analysis of dependencies between the critical business processes and \nsupporting systems; \n\nii. determination of recovery objectives  for the supporting ICT systems (e.g. typically determined \nby the business and/or regulations in terms of RTO and RPO); \n\niii. appropriate contingency planning to enable the availability, continuity, and recovery of critical \nICT systems and services to minimize disruption to an institution’s operations within \nacceptable limits. \n\nb. has business resilience, continuity control environment policies and standards and operational \ncontrols which include: \n\ni. Measures to avoid that a single scenario, incident or disaster might impact both ICT production \nand recovery systems; \n\nii. ICT system backup and recovery procedures for critical software and data, that ensure that \nthese backups are stored in a secure and sufficiently remote location, so that an incident or \ndisaster cannot destroy or corrupt these critical data; \n\niii. monitoring solutions for the timely detection of ICT availability or continuity incidents; \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n18 \n \n\niv. a documented incident management and escalation process, that also provides guidance on \nthe different incident management and escalation roles and responsibilities, the members of \nthe crisis committee(s) and the chain of command in case of emergency;   \n\nv. physical measures to both protect the institution’s critical ICT infrastructure (e.g. data centres) \nfrom environmental risks (e.g. flooding and other natural disasters) and ensure an appropriate \noperating environment for ICT systems (e.g. air conditioning); \n\nvi. processes, roles and responsibilities to ensure that also outsourced ICT systems and services \nare covered by adequate business resilience and continuity solutions and plans; \n\nvii. ICT performance and capacity planning and monitoring solutions for critical ICT systems and \nservices with defined availability requirements, to detect important performance and capacity \nconstraints in a timely manner; \n\nviii. solutions to protect critical internet activities or services (e.g. e-banking services), where \nnecessary and appropriate, against denial of service and other cyber-attacks from the internet, \naimed at preventing or disturbing access to these activities and services. \n\nc. tests ICT availability and continuity solutions, against a range of realistic scenarios including cyber-\nattacks, fail-over tests and tests of back-ups for critical software and data which:  \n\ni. are planned, formalised and documented, and the test results used to strengthen the \neffectiveness of the ICT availability and continuity solutions;  \n\nii. include stakeholders and functions within the organisation, such as business line management \nincluding business continuity, incident and crisis response teams, as well as relevant external \nstakeholders in the ecosystem; \n\niii. management body and senior management are appropriately involved in (e.g. as part of crisis \nmanagement teams) and are informed of test results. \n\n(b) Controls for managing material ICT security risks \n\n55. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an effective framework in place for \nidentifying, understanding, measuring and mitigating ICT security risk. For this assessment competent \nauthorities should, in particular, take into account whether the framework considers:  \n\na. clearly defined roles and responsibilities regarding: \n\ni. the person(s) and/or committees that are responsible and/or accountable for the day to day \nICT security management and the elaboration of the overarching ICT security policies, with \nattention for their needed independence;  \n\nii. the design, implementation, management and monitoring of ICT security controls; \niii. the protection of critical ICT systems and services by adopting for example a vulnerability \n\nassessment process, software patch management, end point protection (e.g. malware virus), \nIntrusion detection and prevention tools;  \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n19 \n \n\niv. the monitoring, classification and handling of external or internal ICT security incidents; \nincluding incident response and the resumption and recovery of the ICT systems and services;  \n\nv. regular and proactive threat assessments to maintain appropriate security controls. \n\nb. an ICT security policy that takes into consideration and, where appropriate, adheres to \ninternationally recognised ICT security standards  and security principles (e.g. the ‘principle of least \nprivilege’ i.e.  limiting access to the minimal level that will allow normal functioning for access right \nmanagement and the principle of “defence in depth” i.e.  layered security mechanisms increase \nsecurity of the system as a whole for designing a security architecture); \n\nc. a process to identify ICT systems, services and commensurate security requirements reflecting \npotential fraud risk and/or possible misuses and/or abuses of confidential data along with \ndocumented security expectations to be adhered to for these identified ICT systems, services and \ndata, aligned with the institution’s risk tolerance and monitored for their correct implementation; \n\nd. a documented security incident management and escalation process, that provides guidance on the \ndifferent incident management and escalation roles and responsibilities, the members of the crisis \ncommittee(s) and the chain of command in case of security emergencies; \n\ne. user and administrative activity logging to enable effective monitoring and the timely detection and \nresponse to unauthorised activity; to assist in or to conduct forensic investigations of security \nincidents. The institution should have in place logging policies that define appropriate types of logs \nto be maintained and their retention period; \n\nf. awareness and information campaigns or initiatives to inform all levels in the institution on the safe \nuse and protection of the institution’s ICT systems and the main ICT security (and other) risks they \nshould be aware of, in particular regarding the existing and evolving cyber threats (e.g. computer \nviruses, possible internal or external abuses or attacks, cyber-attacks) and their role in mitigating \nsecurity breaches; \n\ng. adequate physical security measures  (e.g. CCTV, burglar alarm, security doors) to prevent \nunauthorised physical access to critical and sensitive ICT systems (e.g. data centres);  \n\nh. measures to protect the ICT systems from attacks from the Internet (i.e. cyber-attacks) or other \nexternal networks (e.g. traditional telecom connections or connections with trusted partners). \nCompetent authorities should review whether the institution’s framework considers: \n\ni. a process and solutions to maintain a complete and up to date inventory and overview of \nall the outward facing network connection points (e.g. websites, internet applications, WIFI, \nremote access) through which third parties could break into the internal ICT systems. \n\nii. closely managed and monitored security measures (e.g. firewalls, proxy servers, mail relays, \nantivirus and content scanners) to secure the incoming and outgoing network traffic (e.g. e-\nmail) and the outward facing network connections through which third parties could break \ninto the internal ICT systems;  \n\niii. processes and solutions to secure websites and applications that can be directly attacked \nfrom the internet and/or the outside, that can serve as an entry point into the internal ICT \nsystems. In general these include a combination of recognised secure development \npractices, ICT system hardening and vulnerability scanning practices, and/or the \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n20 \n \n\nimplementation of additional security solutions like for example application firewalls \nand/or intrusion detection (IDS) and/or intrusion prevention (IPS) systems; \n\niv. periodic security penetration testing to assess the effectiveness of implemented cyber and \ninternal ICT security measures and processes. These tests should be performed by staff \nand/or external experts with the necessary expertise, with documented test results and \nconclusions reported to senior management and/or the management body.  Where needed \nand applicable, the institution should learn from these tests where to further improve the \nsecurity controls and processes and/or to obtain better assurance on their effectiveness. \n\n(c) Controls for managing material ICT change risks \n\n56. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an effective framework in place for \nidentifying, understanding, measuring and mitigating ICT change risk commensurate with the nature, \nscale and complexity of the institution’s activities and the ICT risk profile of the institution. The \ninstitution’s framework should cover the risks associated with the development, testing and approval of \nICT systems changes, including the development or change of software, before they are migrated to the \nproduction environment and ensure an adequate ICT lifecycle management. For this assessment \ncompetent authorities should, in particular, take into account whether the framework considers:  \n\na. documented processes for managing and controlling changes to ICT systems (e.g. configuration and \npatch management) and data (e.g. bug fixing or data corrections), ensuring the adequate \ninvolvement of ICT risk management for important ICT changes that may significantly impact the \ninstitution’s risk profile or exposure; \n\nb. specifications regarding the required segregation of duties during the different phases of the \nimplemented ICT change processes (e.g. solution design and development, testing and approval of \nnew software and/or changes, migration and implementation in the production environment, and \nbug fixing), with a focus on the implemented solutions and segregation of duties to manage and \ncontrol changes to the production ICT systems and data by ICT staff (e.g. developers, ICT system \nadministrators, data base administrators) or any other party (e.g. business users, service providers); \n\nc. test environments that adequately reflect production environments;  \n\nd. an asset inventory of the existing applications and ICT systems in the production environment, as \nwell as the test and development environment, so that required changes (e.g. version updates or \nupgrades, systems patching, configuration changes) can be properly managed, implemented and \nmonitored for the involved ICT systems. \n\ne. a process to monitor and manage the life cycle of the used ICT systems, to ensure that they \ncontinue to meet and support the actual business and risk management requirements and to make \nsure that the used ICT solutions and systems are still supported by their vendors; and that this is \naccompanied by adequate software development life cycle (SDLC) procedures. \n\nf. a software source code control system and appropriate procedures to prevent unauthorised \nchanges in the source code of software that is developed in-house; \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n21 \n \n\ng. a process to conduct a security and vulnerability screening of new or materially modified ICT \nsystems and software, before releasing them into production and exposing them to possible cyber-\nattacks; \n\nh. a process and solutions to prevent the unauthorised or unintended disclosure of confidential data, \nwhen replacing, archiving, discarding or destroying ICT systems; \n\ni. an independent review and validation processes to reduce the risks for human errors when \nperforming changes to the ICT systems that may have an important adverse effect on the \navailability, continuity or security of the institution (e.g. important changes to the firewall \nconfiguration), or security of the institution (e.g. changes to the firewalls). \n\n(d) Controls for managing material ICT data integrity risks  \n\n57. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an effective framework in place for \nidentifying understanding, measuring and mitigating ICT data integrity risk commensurate with the \nnature, scale and complexity of the institution’s activities and the ICT risk profile of the institution. The \ninstitution’s framework should consider the risks associated with preserving the integrity of the data \nstored and processed by the ICT systems. For this assessment, competent authorities should, in \nparticular take into account whether the framework considers: \n\na. a policy that defines the roles and responsibilities for managing the integrity of the data in the ICT \nsystems (e.g. data architect, data officers6, data custodians7, data owners/stewards8) and provides \nguidance on which data are critical from a data integrity perspective and should be subject to \nspecific ICT controls (e.g. automated input validation controls, data transfer controls, \nreconciliations, etc.) or reviews (e.g. a compatibility check with the data architecture) in the \ndifferent phases of ICT data life cycle; \n\nb. a documented data architecture, data model and/or dictionary, that is validated with relevant \nbusiness and IT stakeholders to support the needed data consistency across the ICT systems and to \nmake sure that the data architecture, data model and/or dictionary remain aligned with business \nand risk management needs; \n\nc. a policy regarding the allowed usage of and reliance on End User Computing, in particular regarding \nthe identification, registration and documentation of important end user computing solutions (e.g. \nwhen processing important data) and the expected security levels to prevent unauthorised \nmodifications, both in the tool itself, as well as data stored in it;  \n\nd. documented exception handling processes to resolve identified ICT data integrity issues in line with \ntheir criticality and sensitivity. \n\n                                                            \n6 A data officer is responsible for data processing and usage. \n7 A data custodian is responsible for the safe custody, transport and storage of data. \n8 A data steward is responsible for the management and fitness of data elements – both the content and metadata. \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n22 \n \n\n58. For supervised institutions that fall under the scope of the BCBS 239 principles for effective risk data \naggregation and risk reporting9, competent authorities should review the institution’s risk analysis of its \nrisk reporting and data aggregation capabilities compared to the principles and the prepared \ndocumentation thereon, taking into consideration the implementation timeline and transitional \narrangements in these principles.  \n\n(e) Controls for managing material ICT outsourcing risks \n\n59. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution’s outsourcing strategy, in line with the \nrequirements of the CEBS outsourcing Guidelines (2006) and further to the requirement in paragraph 85 \n(d) of the EBA SREP Guidelines, adequately applies to ICT outsourcing, including intra-group outsourcing \nproviding ICT services within the group. When assessing the ICT outsourcing risks, competent authorities \nshould take into consideration that the ICT outsourcing risks can also be covered as part of the \nassessment of inherent operational risks under paragraph 240 (j) of the EBA SREP Guidelines, to avoid \nany duplication of work or double counting.   \n\n60. In particular competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an effective framework in \nplace for identifying, understanding and measuring ICT outsourcing risk, and in particular, controls and a \ncontrol environment in place for mitigating risks related to material outsourced ICT services that are \ncommensurate with the size, activities and the ICT risk profile of the institution and include:  \n\na. an assessment of the impact of the ICT outsourcing on the risk management of the institution \nrelated to the use of service providers (e.g. cloud service providers) and their services during the \nprocurement process that is documented and is taken into account by senior management or the \nmanagement body for the decision to outsource the services or not.  The institution should review \nthe ICT risk management policies and the ICT controls and control environment of the service \nprovider to ensure that they meet the institution’s internal risk management objectives and risk \nappetite.  This review should be periodically updated during the contractual outsourcing period, \ntaking into account the characteristics of the outsourced services ;  \n\nb. a monitoring of the ICT risks of the outsourced services during the contractual outsourcing period \nas part of the institution’s risk management, that feeds into the institution’s ICT risk management \nreporting (e.g. business continuity reporting, security reporting);  \n\nc. a monitoring and comparison of the received service levels with the contractually agreed upon \nservice levels which should form part of the outsourcing contract or service level agreement (SLA); \nand \n\nd. adequate staff, resources and competences to monitor and manage the ICT risks from the \noutsourced services. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                            \n9 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting, January \n2013, available online: http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs239.pdf. \n\n\n\nGUIDELINES ON ICT RISK ASSESSMENT UNDER SREP  \n\n \n \n\n23 \n \n\n3.4 Summary of findings and scoring \n\n61. Following the above assessment, competent authorities should form an opinion on the institution’s ICT \nrisk. This opinion should be reflected in a summary of findings which competent authorities should \nconsider when assigning the score of operational risk in Table 6 of the EBA SREP Guidelines. Competent \nauthorities should base their view on material ICT risks taking into account the following considerations \nto feed into the operational risk assessment: \n\na. Risk Considerations \n\ni. The institution’s ICT risk profile and exposures;  \nii. The identified critical ICT systems and services; and \n\niii. The materiality of ICT risk regarding critical ICT systems.  \n \n\nb. Management and Controls considerations \n\ni. Whether there is consistency between the institution’s ICT risk management policy and \nstrategy and its overall strategy and risk appetite; \n\nii. Whether the organisational framework for ICT risk management is robust with clear \nresponsibilities and a clear separation of tasks between risk owners and management and \ncontrol functions;  \n\niii. Whether ICT risk measurement, monitoring and reporting systems are appropriate.; and \niv. Whether the control frameworks for material ICT risks are sound.  \n\n62.  If competent authorities deem ICT risk to be material and the competent authority decides to assess \nand score this risk as a sub-category of operational risk the table below (Table 1) provides the ICT risk \nscore considerations. \n\n \n\nTable 1: Supervisory considerations for assigning an ICT risk score \n\nRisk \nScore \n\nSupervisory view Considerations for inherent risk Considerations for
