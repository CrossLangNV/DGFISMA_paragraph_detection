The TLTROs-II are intended to strengthen the transmission of monetary policy by further incentivising bank lending to the non-financial private sector, i.e. households and non-financial corporations, in Member States whose currency is the euro. This measure is not intended to support bank lending to households for the purposes of house purchases. Eligible lending to the non-financial private sector in the context of this measure therefore excludes loans to households for the purposes of house purchases. In conjunction with other non-standard measures in place, TLTROs-II aim to contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2 % over the medium term.</TXT></NP></CONSID><CONSID><NP><NO.P>(3)</NO.P><TXT>As with the first series of TLTROs, in order to facilitate the participation of institutions that, for organisational reasons, borrow from the Eurosystem by means of a group structure, participation in TLTROs-II will be possible on a group basis where there is an institutional basis for group treatment. Group participation will be conducted through one specific group member and where prescribed conditions have been fulfilled. Moreover, in order to address the issues related to intra-group liquidity distribution, in the case of groups that are established on the basis of close links between members, all group members will have to formally confirm in writing their participation in the group.
